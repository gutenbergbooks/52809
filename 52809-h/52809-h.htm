<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Lost</span></p>

<p>“Ken! Ken Armstrong! Dinner is ready.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming, Mother,” he called from his
room upstairs.</p>

<p>Hurriedly he finished brushing his hair and
raced downstairs to the dining room. His father
was already at the table and waiting for the children
to take their places. Mrs. Armstrong in the
meanwhile was adding the finishing touches in
setting the table. “Before you sit down, Ken,” his
mother told him, “will you please go out and call
Betty. She must be outside somewhere playing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother.”</p>

<p>Ken obeyed and went outside to look for his
younger sister, who was five years old. It was a
day in the latter part of August, warm, clear.
Stepping out on the porch, he called out, “Betty!
Betty!”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Ken looked in the yard,
then in the garage where she sometimes climbed
into the back of the car and amused herself playing
with her doll. But she was not there either.
Ken walked across the street and rang the Smiths’
doorbell. Mrs. Smith herself answered and Ken
asked, “Is Betty here, Mrs. Smith?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head. “No,” she answered. “She
was playing with my little Helen until about an
hour ago, when she left.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Ken said and walked away. On
the sidewalk, he paused to think of all the places
where she might be. Ken walked further down the
street and stopped at the Morrison home. Paul
answered the doorbell. “Hello, Ken,” he called.</p>

<p>“Hello, Paul. Is Betty here playing with your
little brother?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Ken. Pete has been at the park all
day and has just returned.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” muttered Ken.</p>

<p>“What’s strange?”</p>

<p>“I can’t seem to find her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll find her,” Paul assured his friend.
“She may be playing with little Karliner across
the street.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I didn’t think of it. Thanks,
Paul.”</p>

<p>“So long, Ken. Don’t forget the meeting
tonight.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Ken called back over his shoulder.
He went across the street to the Karliner home
and rang the doorbell. Mrs. Karliner opened the
door. “Is Betty here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the youthful woman. “Betty
and Karl had a childish quarrel this morning and
they quit playing together.”</p>

<p>“Until tomorrow,” remarked Ken, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, no matter how much they quarrel the
children always come together again,” she said,
also laughing.</p>

<p>“And it is a good thing they do,” added the
boy.</p>

<p>“Yes. And in that respect, grown ups would do
well to take after children.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Mrs. Karliner.” Ken edged
away from the doorway. “You will excuse me, but
I have to find Betty.”</p>

<p>The woman smiled and closed the door. Ken
walked back toward his own house. He was puzzled
and couldn’t think where else his younger
sister might be. Usually she was somewhere in
the neighborhood. If she wasn’t in her own yard,
she could always be found either at the Morrisons,
the Smiths or the Karliners. But today she wasn’t
at any one of those places. As he entered his own
yard, Ken thought of one other place where she
might be. Around the corner was a small park
where Mrs. Armstrong very often took the child
to play. Perhaps she had gone there with some
other child. Ken thought he better run over there
in a hurry before his mother became worried.
However, there were only a few children there
because it was dinner time. And no Betty. He
walked through the playground twice. No sign
of his sister.</p>

<p>For the first time, Ken became anxious. Of
course, she was not lost, he thought to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
But where could she be? Slowly he walked home
without coming to any definite opinion. Stepping
onto the porch noiselessly, he hesitated to enter
the house. If he told his mother he could not find
Betty, she might become frightened. He conceived
another idea. Walking around to the side of the
house, he peeked through the window into the
dining room. Seeing that his mother was not
there, he knocked on the window and motioned
for his father to come outside. Mr. Armstrong
came out onto the porch. “What’s the trouble,
Ken?” he asked.</p>

<p>The boy tried hard not to look anxious. “Dad,
I can’t seem to find Betty,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong was a tall, heavy set man. He
tugged at his close cropped mustache and muttered,
“You can’t seem to find her, eh? Did you
look everywhere?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“At the Morrisons?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was also at the Smiths, the Karliners
and at the park, Dad. She was not at any one of
those places.”</p>

<p>“Hmm!” mused Mr. Armstrong. “She must be
somewhere around, Ken. Let us first search the
yard thoroughly.”</p>

<p>Together they looked over the yard and then
the garage. But the child was not there. Finally
they stopped their search. “You say that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
were to the park, at the Morrisons, the Smiths,
the Karliners?” asked Mr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Can you think of anywhere else she might be?
Do you know of any other child she occasionally
plays with?”</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Armstrong came out onto the
porch and called, “Ken, John, what are you doing
out here when you are supposed to be at the dinner
table? And where is Betty?”</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong walked slowly over to his wife
and said, “Now, Edna, don’t you become upset.
It seems that Betty is nowhere where she usually
plays. Do you know of any other child she sometimes
plays with and with whom she might be
now?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong became very pale. “Were you
to the Karliners, Ken?” she queried anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t you become alarmed, Edna. The
child is somewhere around. But she may have
walked off alone somewhere or she might be playing
at some house.”</p>

<p>“Were you to the Johnsons?” Mrs. Armstrong
asked. Ken shook his head. “Then run over and
see. And if she is not there, stop in at the
McKinlys.”</p>

<p>Ken was off at a run. The Johnson home was
at the end of the street. Junior himself opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the door and Ken bent down to question the
child. “Is Betty here?” he asked.</p>

<p>The little boy shook his head and muttered,
“Nah.” Mrs. Johnson came to the door and he
asked her the same question. “Why, no,” she
replied. “She never comes. I would like very much
for her to come and play with Junior, but she
never does. I guess it is a little too far away for
her.”</p>

<p>Ken was anxious to be off. “Yes, I guess so,”
he answered. “Excuse me.” And he was off.</p>

<p>The McKinly home was across the street. But
she was not there either. Ken walked away deeply
concerned. Returning home he found his parents
awaiting him, their faces drawn and worried. At
the news that the child was neither at the Johnsons
nor the McKinlys, Mrs. Armstrong clenched
her fingers. Her husband stood up. “She must
have walked off somewhere,” he said. “I’ll notify
the police and have them search for her.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Dad,” cried Ken. “Perhaps
she is in her room.”</p>

<p>Without losing a second, he dashed up the
stairs. A minute later he was coming down slowly.
By the expression on his face the parents could
tell that she was not in her room. Mr. Armstrong
walked to the foyer where the telephone was and
they could hear him calling the police and giving
a detailed description of the child. She was five
years old, blonde hair and blue eyes, weighed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
forty-five and fifty pounds and was about
twenty-six or twenty-seven inches tall. His task
completed, he returned to the dining room. He
put an arm around his wife’s shoulder and said,
“Now, don’t worry, Edna. The child most likely
has walked off by herself and she will be found.
You will have her again in half an hour.”</p>

<p>Ken jumped out of his chair and dashed out
of the house. He ran over to the Morrison home
and called Paul. Drawing his friend aside, he
whispered, “Paul, call the troop together. We cannot
find Betty and we have to make a search for
her.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” replied Paul. “I’m sure no
harm has come to her and we will find her.”</p>

<p>The two boys walked off to call the boys together.
Some of the Boy Scouts lived in the immediate
neighborhood while the others were reached
by telephone. Practically every one of them knew
Betty by sight, but just to make sure a description
of her was passed around. Within ten minutes the
entire Stanhope Troop No. 1 was out on the
streets and searching for the child. In the meanwhile
the police had also sent out an alarm and
were combing the town to find Betty. The news
had spread and many townspeople had joined in
the search.</p>

<p>For the next half hour every nook and corner
of the town was ransacked. Many a little girl
was stopped and asked if her name was Betty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Armstrong. But always it was a shake of the head
and the word no. Suddenly the news spread that
the search was off and that the child was safely
home. Ken, who was with Paul, sprinted home.
The two boys burst into the house and found
Betty sitting very calmly at the table having
her dinner. Quite innocently she shook a finger
a her big brother and scolded him. “You’re late,”
she told him. “Mama is angry if you come late
for dinner.”</p>

<p>The two boys, hot and out of breath as they
were, couldn’t resist laughing at the innocent
humor of the child. “Where were you?” Ken
demanded.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Armstrong came in. Seeing his
missing child at the table, he sighed with relief.
Mrs. Armstrong came in from the kitchen and
said, “You men better have your dinner right
away, before it gets spoiled.”</p>

<p>Paul moved away, saying, “I will wait for you
upstairs, Ken, in your room.”</p>

<p>“Jack is also upstairs,” mentioned Mrs. Armstrong.
“He found the child and brought her
home.”</p>

<p>Paul walked upstairs while Mr. Armstrong
turned to his wife and asked, “Where did he find
her?”</p>

<p>“On Leonard Street.”</p>

<p>“So far away!” exclaimed Ken. “Leonard
Street is at the edge of the town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What was she doing there?” asked Mr.
Armstrong.</p>

<p>“Who knows?” his wife exclaimed.</p>

<p>Ken turned to his younger sister. “What were
you doing so far away from home?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother the child now,” asserted his
mother. “Let us eat now. You can ask her all the
questions you want later or tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother.”</p>

<p>The family settled down to their meal and for
the present tried to forget the anxiety and worry
the child had caused them.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get away from the table,
Ken did so and raced upstairs. Dashing into his
room, he called out, “Hello, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Ken. I hear Betty gave you a bad
scare.”</p>

<p>“And how!” added Paul. “The only ones we did
not have searching for her were the marines, and
only because there are none in Stanhope.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is just what I want to ask you about,
Jack. How did you come to find her?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“I was out that way visiting Bud Menninger.
You know him, don’t you, Ken?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is the fellow who wants to join our
troop, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” answered Jack. “Well, I was
riding home on my bicycle when I happened to
notice Betty walking along, all by herself. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
so surprised, I wouldn’t believe my eyes at first.
I couldn’t imagine what she would be doing so
far away from home. At any rate, I jumped off
my bike and approached her and then I saw that
it was really her. She was sucking a large peppermint
stick.”</p>

<p>“Sucking a peppermint stick!” exclaimed Ken.
“Who gave it to her?”</p>

<p>“That is just the point. I asked her and she
replied that a man gave it to her.”</p>

<p>“A man!&mdash;”</p>

<p>Paul interrupted. “Don’t interrupt, Ken,” he
said. “Listen to the rest of the story. It is mighty
interesting.”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t interrupt. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I questioned her a little more,” continued
Jack, “and she told me that she was walking
home from the Smiths when a man stopped
her and asked if she wanted some candy. Like a
child, she couldn’t refuse. So he took her by the
hand and he bought her that peppermint stick
she was sucking.”</p>

<p>“Then what?” Ken asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“From further questioning, it seems that after
he bought her the candy, they just kept on walking.
I looked her over closely and saw that she
was not all frightened or hurt in any way. So it
seems that the man who took her walking, did
not harm her in the least.”</p>

<p>“But how come he left her at the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
town all by herself. A man must be crazy to do
a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Now that is a clue,” spoke up Paul. “An ordinary
man would not do a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Clue!” exclaimed Ken, surprised. “What sort
of clue? What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Let me finish,” urged Jack. “As I was talking
to her, I noticed that she kept one hand behind
her back. I asked her why and she just shrugged
her shoulders. I looked and I saw that she was
clutching a card in her little fist. I asked where
she got it and she told me that the man gave it
to her before he left her. I asked her to give it to
me and she did. Here it is.”</p>

<p>Jack held up the white card, three inches by
two inches. The boys huddled together, examining
it. “Why, it is just a plain, blank, white card!”
exclaimed Ken.</p>

<p>“That’s right. But what is the meaning of it?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The three boys were
mystified. The whole story sounded very odd and
the card made it all the more perplexing. “From
all the evidence at hand,” remarked Paul, “I am
convinced that there must be something wrong
with the man who walked off with the child.”</p>

<p>“But that’s just it,” exploded Ken. “If there
is something wrong with the man, he must be
found out and put away into an asylum. He can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
be permitted to roam the streets and walk away
with children.”</p>

<p>“And if Paul’s suggestions are correct,” added
Jack, “God knows what other tricks he might
be up to and what damage he may be doing.”</p>

<p>“Now let’s think this out calmly and logically,”
said Paul. “First did you ask Betty to describe the
man?”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Jack. “But all she would say
was that he was tall and very kind to her.”</p>

<p>“There are many tall men in town. That is no
clue,” said Ken.</p>

<p>Paul rose. “We certainly have to look into the
matter and see what we can do.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Ken. “As far as I
know there are no crazy people in Stanhope and
only a lunatic would do a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“We have about an hour before the meeting,”
suggested Jack. “Suppose we go down to Leonard
Street and look around.”</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Armstrong came in. “Hello,
Jack,” he greeted.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Armstrong.”</p>

<p>He saw that the boys seemed to be on the verge
of leaving and he said, “I hope I am not keeping
you boys from going on your way.”</p>

<p>“Well, we were preparing to leave, but&mdash;” that
from Ken.</p>

<p>“I merely want to ask Jack about his finding
Betty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack repeated his story, leaving out the part
about the white card. For a while there was
silence. Mr. Armstrong mused. Finally he said,
“It must have been some man who knows the
family and bought her some candy.”</p>

<p>“But why should he leave her at the end of the
town to walk back alone,” demanded Ken.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong shrugged his shoulders wearily.
“I can’t understand that myself,” he said. “But
the fact remains that the child was not harmed.
Which leads us to the conclusion that the man
must have been a friend.”</p>

<p>The boys had no desire to argue with the older
man and so they left it at that. In the street, Ken
asked, “Why did you leave out that part about
the white card, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it mattered,” was the answer.
“I figured that if I told him about it, he would
give it over to the police, and then it would get
into the newspapers and then everybody would
know about it. And the guilty man, even if he is
crazy, would know better than to do anything to
give himself away. As it is, nobody knows, except
the three of us, and by a little quiet work we may
track the culprit down.”</p>

<p>“I think you did right,” spoke up Paul.</p>

<p>“That is to be seen,” added Ken skeptically.</p>

<p>The boys walked down to Leonard Street and
Jack pointed out the exact spot where he came
upon Betty. The neighborhood was one occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
mostly by the poorer people of the town. Of
course, there was nothing to be found in the way
of clues. They walked all around the neighborhood
and noticed the various shacks and empty
lots but did not come across any man that was tall
and kindly looking. At last they decided to give
up the search and go to a meeting of their boy
scout troop, the Red Fox Patrol.</p>

<p>All the other boys&mdash;Nuthin’, The Carberry
twins, William and Wallace, Bobolink, Bluff&mdash;were
already there when the three arrived.
Pressed for information, Jack for the third time
re-told his story.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Fire!</span></p>

<p>Several days passed and although the boys
had not forgotten the incident, they did nothing
to look for the culprit. The only evidence they
had was the white card and the information that
the man was tall.</p>

<p>It was about five-thirty and the boys were coming
from the baseball field. Paul and William,
walking ahead, turned into Water Street, and the
rest of the boys followed them. At about the middle
of the street, they suddenly heard the weird
cry, “Fire! Help! Fire!”</p>

<p>The boys stopped in their tracks and looked
around to find where the cry was coming from.
Paul began to run and the boys followed him.
They came upon a two story frame house. Dense
clouds of smoke came billowing out of the doorway.
Paul turned to the one nearest him, who
happened to be William, and ordered, “Call the
Fire Department! Hurry!”</p>

<p>William set off at a run. Paul, followed by the
other boys, ran to the back of the house. He cried,
“A couple of you try to find buckets and water.
The others stick around and form a water brigade
until the firemen come.”</p>

<p>Pushing open the back door, he dashed into the
house. He noticed that the smoke was dense at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the front door. Just as he turned to run up the
stairs, tongues of flames shot out of the smoke.
The thought came to him that the fire had started
at the front door. But how? Why? At the front
door, of all places.</p>

<p>He raced upstairs and threw open the first door
that he came upon. No one there. He dashed for
the next room. An old man and woman, in their
late seventies, if not older, were rushing back and
forth, picking up things and dropping them. They
were so bewildered, they did not know what to do.
As Paul dashed in, they rushed at him and clung
to his arms. They were absolutely speechless; they
did nothing but tremble. Paul shook them off and
rushed to the window, threw it open and cried
to the boys below, “Get a ladder! Get a ladder!”</p>

<p>He looked for the firemen but they had not yet
arrived. Every second seemed to him an hour. He
saw the boys scatter in a frantic search for a ladder.
The five minutes that elapsed to procure a
ladder seemed like an age. At last Bobolink came
running up with a ladder and he placed it under
the window. But it was too short, and Paul cried,
“Get something to stand it on. A box. Anything.”</p>

<p>Bobolink scurried to find something upon which
to stand the ladder. A minute later he returned
with a soap box. The ladder was stood on the box
and several of the boys supported it. Paul helped
the old woman through the window onto the ladder.
“One of you boys climb up and help her down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw the boys hesitate. Evidently they
thought that the ladder would not hold. In the
meanwhile, the woman, trembling and bewildered,
almost fell from the ladder. Bluff raced up and
directed the woman’s legs, rung by rung. The old
woman at last descended and collapsed in Ken’s
arms. Paul turned to the old man. “Is there anybody
else in the house?” he asked briskly.</p>

<p>The old man nodded his head vigorously.
“Downstairs,” his trembling lips mumbled. “A
baby in a crib.”</p>

<p>“Which room?”</p>

<p>The old man’s teeth chattered so violently that
he could not speak. Again Paul demanded to
know which room the child was in but the old
man could not talk. He almost hurled the man
through the window as he helped him to gain a
footing on the ladder. Without waiting another
instant, Paul dashed out of the room and down
the stairs which by now were crackling with
flames. The last couple of steps were so badly
burned that he had to jump. He scurried about
wildly and at last found what he was searching
for&mdash;a pail of water. Dipping his handkerchief
into it, he clasped the wet rag over his mouth and
nostrils. Layers of heavy smoke whirled all about
him. He walked along the wall and listened carefully.
An infant’s wailing came to his ears and he
searched frantically for the door. Finding it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
last, he threw it open and stepped in quickly. He
brought in with him a dense cloud of smoke. He
moved blindly about the room, directed only by
the cries of the infant. He stumbled against the
crib and clasped the child to him. Smoke entered
his lungs and he began to cough. He felt choked
and was sure he was going to collapse before he
managed to get out. He heard a shattering crash.
Someone had broken the window and he ran to
it. He felt someone take the child from him and
direct him to the broken window. Someone lifted
him almost bodily through the window and the
next moment he fainted.</p>

<p>About fifteen or twenty minutes after the
alarm had been sent in, the Volunteer Fire Brigade
came clanging down the street. Immediately
they pulled out the hose and set to work. Captain
Bob was there. It was he who had helped Paul
through the window. About a minute after Paul
had been taken out of the house, there was a terrible
shattering and crackling. From all sides of
the house streaks of flame spurted forth, until the
whole building was enveloped in a sheet of flame.</p>

<p>Paul came to and opened his eyes to find his
father bending over him. “Are you all right, fellow?”
Dr. Morrison asked.</p>

<p>Paul sat up and blinked his eyes. He nodded.
“I’m all right, Dad. What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Just happened to come along.”</p>

<p>His father helped him to his feet and he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the boys crowding around him. “How do you
feel?” asked William.</p>

<p>Paul nodded. Ken remarked, “Some fire eater
you are.”</p>

<p>He smiled and turned to watch the firemen
fighting the blazing structure. “What happened
to the old couple?” he asked.</p>

<p>“They are all right,” answered Nuthin’. “They
wouldn’t have been, though, if it hadn’t been for
you.”</p>

<p>Bobolink added, “The child would surely have
perished if not for you, Paul.”</p>

<p>Just then a policeman came and pushed them
all back. Some moments later the front door fell
in with a shattering thud. The firemen poured
gallons of water into the blaze but it did not seem
to help. The fire ate through the wooden house and
ten minutes later one of the walls collapsed. A
groan rose up from the watching crowd and some
turned their heads away. As the wall collapsed
tongues of flame and dense smoke came shooting
out. Some of the firemen retreated and then returned
to continue their struggle with the blaze.</p>

<p>Another wall caved in and eventually the roof
of the house came crashing down. Captain Bob
realized that further effort was futile and he
ordered his firemen to just stand around and let
the fire burn itself out. Soon the house was a
heap of ashes and smoldering pieces of wood. The
firemen left and the crowd dispersed.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Paul Looks Into the Matter</span></p>

<p>Jack was sitting on the Morrison porch. It was
about eight o’clock in the evening of the same day.
Ken came walking up through the yard. “Hello,
Ken.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack. What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Waiting for Paul.”</p>

<p>Ken came onto the porch and sat down beside
his friend. “Did Paul call you too?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That’s right. He told me over the telephone
that he had something important to talk over.”</p>

<p>“He told me the same thing. I wonder what it
is.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is something about the fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s not guess, but wait for Paul to tell
us instead.”</p>

<p>Several minutes later, Paul came out. “Hello,
fellows,” he called.</p>

<p>“Hello, Paul.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Paul. What is it you have to tell us?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Let’s go where we will have some privacy,”
answered Paul.</p>

<p>Paul led them into the garage and the three
boys piled into the back of the car. “Now,” said
Ken, “you can tell us without anyone overhearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
us. Don’t keep us in suspense any longer or we
will collapse of curiosity.”</p>

<p>“First tell us how you feel,” spoke up Jack.
“Any after effects from the smoke?”</p>

<p>“I feel perfectly all right,” was the answer.
“Now, this is what I want to talk to you about.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it all about?”&mdash;that from Ken.</p>

<p>“Jack,” began Paul, “do you still have that
white card? You know the one I mean.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I still have it, certainly. What
about it?”</p>

<p>“Will you show it to me?”</p>

<p>Jack began to look through his pockets. Finally
he confessed, “I guess I don’t have it with me. I
must have left it home, in my other coat pocket.”</p>

<p>“What about the card?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Only this,” replied Paul gravely. And he
showed them the card. “Is it the same card?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Jack examined it very closely. “To me it appears
as though it is the very self-same card. How
did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Now listen closely,” whispered Paul. The
other two boys leaned over. “I rushed down the
burning stairs to find the room in which the child
was. Well, I was groping along the wall with my
hands because I couldn’t see a thing. I came upon
the door and I moved my hand up and down trying
to find the knob when I came upon something
sticking in the doorway. Without thinking any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
further, I grabbed it and shoved it into my
pocket.” Paul paused to add emphasis to his
forthcoming statement. “And that thing was this
card,” he concluded.</p>

<p>The boys gasped. “This card!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Absolutely positive,” asserted Paul.</p>

<p>“But how did it get there?”</p>

<p>“That is something I don’t know and which I
would very much like to know.”</p>

<p>For about a minute the boys sat there in silence,
overcome with amazement. Jack jumped out of
the car. “Come on, fellows,” he called.</p>

<p>“Where to?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“To my house. I want to find that card.”</p>

<p>Jack was so excited, he had difficulty in restraining
himself from running. The other boys kept up
with him, walking briskly. At the Stormways
home, Jack rushed up the steps of the porch.
“You wait here,” he called over his shoulder to
his companions.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he came rushing out of the
doorway. “Here it is,” he cried, waving the white
card.</p>

<p>The two cards were compared; they were
identical in every respect. “This is getting to be
serious,” whispered Ken.</p>

<p>“Terribly serious,” added Ken. “We must do
something about it. The man must be absolutely
crazy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Crazy is not the word,” said Paul. “Dangerous
is more fitting. If he is permitted to roam the
streets without being stopped, only God knows
what damage he will do and what crimes he may
commit.”</p>

<p>“But what can we do?” Jack questioned anxiously.
“Our suspicions are only a hunch. These
cards may only be an accident.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Paul, shaking his head. “My opinion
is that this is no accident but the work of a
distorted mind.”</p>

<p>The boys sat down on the porch. At a loss as to
the meaning of it all, they remained silent. Paul
whispered, “I’ll tell you what we can do, though.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go over and see Captain Bob.”</p>

<p>“What for?” queried Ken.</p>

<p>“I want to ask his opinion on the origin of the
fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, that won’t hurt any,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>The three boys set off. Captain Bob himself
opened the door for them and led them into the
living room. Turning to Paul, the Captain said,
“You are the boy that dashed into the burning
building this afternoon, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was really nothing.”</p>

<p>Captain Bob sat himself down and pointed the
boys to seats. “Well,” he drawled, “you are a
modest boy. But if it hadn’t been for you, the old
folks and the child would have burned to cinders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I had not entered, one of the other boys
would have,” he answered. “We were the first on
the scene, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so I understand. But what is it I can do
for you boys?”</p>

<p>Paul leaned forward in his chair. “Captain
Bob,” he said, “we came over to ask you your
opinion on the origin of the fire.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you want to know?”</p>

<p>Paul hesitated, not knowing exactly how to put
his question. He said, “What I want to know,
Captain, is whether you think the fire was&mdash;er,&mdash;an
accident, or whether you think someone
started the fire.”</p>

<p>“You are asking very serious questions,” replied
Captain, knitting his brows.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but I am very much interested
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“May I ask why you should be interested?”
asked the old man shrewdly.</p>

<p>“It’s only because,&mdash;er,&mdash;when I dashed into
the building, I noticed something very odd about
the fire.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, as we ran up to the house, we noticed
smoke pouring out of the front door. I dashed
inside by the back door and then I saw that most
of the smoke and fire seemed to be at the threshold
of the front door. Now that is very odd.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are quite right, my boy,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Captain Bob. “As a matter of fact, the front door
caved in first. However, I came to the fire a little
too late to really judge the cause or origin of the
fire. But it did seem to me that there was something
odd about the whole thing.”</p>

<p>“Was there anything about the fire that would
lead you to believe that it was an accident or perhaps&mdash;er,&mdash;otherwise?”
asked Paul, pressing his
point.</p>

<p>Captain Bob scratched his chin thoughtfully
and said, “My dear boy, you are asking some very
serious questions that may get you into trouble.”</p>

<p>Paul insisted. “Just the same, would you form
an opinion?”</p>

<p>“No, I really couldn’t because, as I said before,
I came to the fire too late. I had no chance to
look into the cause of the fire and now that the
house is a heap of ashes, the chances of finding
any clue is very slight. Suppose you tell me your
opinion, my boy.”</p>

<p>“To be quite frank, Captain, I think that the
fire was started by some pyromaniac.”</p>

<p>The Captain sat up in his chair. “What makes
you think so?” he demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>Paul hesitated. He did not want to give himself
away. “Just a hunch,” he replied.</p>

<p>Captain Bob sank back into his chair. For what
seemed a very long time there was absolute
silence. The Captain seemed to be musing over
something and the boys had nothing more to say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Paul rose and his friends did likewise. “Thank
you, Captain Bob,” said Paul. “I guess we will be
going now.”</p>

<p>Escorting them to the door, the Captain said,
“Don’t thank me. I am glad you came.” He hesitated.
“And,&mdash;er,&mdash;don’t you go around talking
about a pyromaniac, my boy. It may get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, Captain,” promised Paul.</p>

<p>“Goodnight, boys.”</p>

<p>“Goodnight, Captain Bob.”</p>

<p>The boys walked along for some few steps in
silence. Ken spoke up. “That talk with the captain
didn’t help much, did it, Paul?”</p>

<p>“No, very little. But I have now become more
convinced than ever that the fire was the work
of a mentally distorted person.”</p>

<p>“You count me in on that,” added Jack. “I certainly
agree with you. But what can we do about
it, that is the problem.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem as if we can do anything for the
present,” muttered Ken.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” answered Paul thoughtfully.
A moment later he added, “Tomorrow let
us try and obtain a better description of the man
from your sister, Betty, Ken. If she can tell us a
few things on how he looks and the sort of clothes
he wears, that would help a lot.”</p>

<p>“It certainly would,” agreed Ken. “We will try
it tomorrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. In the meanwhile there is nothing else we
can do tonight. So I am for going home,” announced Paul.</p>

<p>“Same here.”</p>

<p>“Me too.”</p>

<p>The boys separated and went home. The following
morning, they met again at Ken’s home.
Taking Betty out into the yard, the boys tried to
get some information from her about the man
who had taken her for a walk and then deserted
her at the end of the town. But the child had already
forgotten him entirely and their efforts
were in vain.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Detectives</span></p>

<p>That afternoon, William went to the Stanhope
Free Public Library to return a book. Walking in
back of the room in search of a good novel, he
came upon Paul hunched over a stack of newspapers.
“What are you up to now, Paul?” he
asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Tell you later.”</p>

<p>“A mystery, huh?” William joked.</p>

<p>Paul smiled and waved his friend away. “Leave
me alone now,” he said, “I’ll tell you all about it
later.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>William walked away and Paul returned to his
stack of newspapers. He spent almost three hours
going through the papers of the past two months.
Tired, he decided to stop there. Besides, he was
quite satisfied with the information he had obtained.
He left the library and walked home. On
the way he stopped to call for Ken but did not
find him in. Crossing the street to his own home
he found Jack, Ken and William on the porch
waiting for him. “Well, what is the secret?”
cried William. “Tell us.”</p>

<p>Paul motioned to the boys to follow him and he
led them to the garage where they would be assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of privacy. The boys found boxes on which
to sit and they gathered around Paul. “Well, what
is it?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I have spent about three hours in the library
this afternoon,” Paul informed them “and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“William told us that already,” interrupted
Ken.</p>

<p>“I have been going through the newspapers
for the past weeks,” continued Paul.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I was looking up the fire reports. In the past
two months there have been four fires, one each
two weeks or so.”</p>

<p>“What about it?” Jack wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Can’t you fellows see for yourselves?” asked
Paul, irritated by their indifference. “Don’t you
think that in a small town such as this, a fire every
two weeks is very much above the average?”</p>

<p>“Say,” cried Ken, “you have hit upon something.
Come to think of it, that is a pretty high
average.”</p>

<p>“But what has that to do with the story?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Simply this,” answered Paul. “Under normal
conditions, there would not be such frequent fires.
In other words, all the fires of the past two
months may or may not have been caused
accidentally.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think yesterday’s fire was an accident?”
questioned William.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” was Paul’s categorical answer.</p>

<p>William raised his eyebrows in surprise. He
was not acquainted with the facts of the case as
the other boys were. “What therefore is the conclusion?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“It is evident,” returned Paul. “For the past
two months at least one fire, or more has been
started by a maniac.”</p>

<p>“This thing is becoming worse and worse,”
commented Ken.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Paul said gravely, “the situation is very
serious and it is up to us to do something.”</p>

<p>“Why is it up to us?” asked William. But just
as soon as the words were out of his mouth, he
knew the answer.</p>

<p>“Because,” was Paul’s answer, “we are the
only ones who seem to be acquainted with the
situation and our suspicions are quite definite.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it might be wise to acquaint
the police with our suspicions?” inquired Ken.</p>

<p>“I am against doing anything of the sort,”
stated Jack. “If we do that, there will be a public
scandal. It will be in every newspaper in town and
the culprit, whoever he is, will become wary. As
it is, we may come upon him by surprise.”</p>

<p>“I agree absolutely,” commented Paul.</p>

<p>“What is our job going to be?” asked William,
eager to do something as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“For the present there is only one thing we can
do,” said Paul. “We will talk the whole matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
over with the boys of the patrol. We are all pretty
close friends and we can act as a group. The thing
we have to insist upon is secrecy on the part of all
the boys and to be always on guard.”</p>

<p>“That alone is not enough,” added William. “I
suggest that we also have the boys patrolling the
streets, so that in case of anything, they will be
Johnny-on-the-spot.”</p>

<p>“That is something we will have to discuss with
the rest of the boys,” asserted Paul. “In the
meanwhile, suppose we notify the fellows to come
to a meeting tonight after supper. Do you think
it is all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that is a very good idea,” commented
William. The other boys agreed and it
was decided to meet in Ken’s garage.</p>

<p>That evening at about seven, the boys began to
congregate in Ken’s garage. They came by one’s
and two’s. Fifteen minutes later they were all
there except Jack. The boys were curious as to
the reason for the meeting and they wanted to
start without waiting for the missing member but
Paul refused. He suggested that someone run
over to call Jack. Bluff volunteered. They waited
about five minutes and the messenger returned
saying that Jack was not home. Paul remarked, “I
wonder where he could have gone?”</p>

<p>Nuthin’ said, “He will most likely be here any
minute. In the meanwhile let’s get going.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s do that,” echoed Wallace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Urged on by the other boys, Paul finally consented
and the meeting was called to order. Paul
then outlined the situation for them, told them
the pros and cons of the problem and in conclusion
said, “There is one more thing I want to tell you.
In going through the newspaper files for information
on the fire reports, I noticed that there
seemed to be about two weeks difference between
fires. In other words, since the last fire was yesterday,
we have about two weeks in which to act.
The thing for us to do now is not to talk about it
to anyone outside of this group and to be always
on guard. If we don’t track this maniac down,
God knows what damage he is liable to do.”</p>

<p>For a short while there was silence. Nuthin’
grinned and remarked, “What you want us to do,
Paul, is for us to become detectives.”</p>

<p>Nuthin’ meant it as a joke but Paul took it seriously.
“That is just what I want you to do,” he
asserted gravely. “We must all become detectives
and find this man.”</p>

<p>“But the information we have is so slight. We
really have no clues to work on,” protested Bobolink.</p>

<p>“That is very true,” replied Paul, “but we must
do the best we can.”</p>

<p>A little later, the meeting was officially adjourned,
but no boy ventured to leave. Their curiosity
was aroused by Jack’s not coming to the
meeting and they waited around. Paul felt anxious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
though he had no reason to be. To Ken, who
was sitting beside him, he whispered, “I wonder
what happened to Jack!”</p>

<p>Ken shrugged his shoulders. “I can’t imagine.
He promised to be here. And he is not home
either.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” countered Paul. “The fact
that he is not home implied that he was on the
way over here. But something must have happened
on the way to keep him from coming to the
meeting.”</p>

<p>“We can go over and see if he is home now.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>Ken and Paul rose and the other boys did likewise.
In a group they walked over to Jack’s house.
Ken went in while all the others remained outside.
A minute later he emerged and motioned that the
missing boy was not home. The boys were disappointed
and a few of them became worried. Bobolink
commented, “This is becoming serious. We
ought to look for him.”</p>

<p>Paul turned the idea down. “You fellows better
go home,” he said, “and don’t worry. Jack has a
right to go wherever he pleases and if he did not
show up at the meeting, there must be a good reason
for it.”</p>

<p>“But where could he have gone,” Nuthin’ asked
anxiously. “After all, something may have happened
to him.”</p>

<p>Paul, though he was anxious himself, made believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that there was nothing to worry about and
laughed at the suggestion that something might
have happened to Jack. “Most likely he went to
see someone or something like that,” he remarked
casually. “Nothing serious could have happened
to him.”</p>

<p>“Besides, he is the sort of fellow who can take
care of himself,” added Ken.</p>

<p>“And what’s more,” argued Paul again, “we
don’t know where to look for him. And if we
spread an alarm, his folks will become worried
and that is something we certainly don’t want.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess you are right, Paul,” agreed
Nuthin’.</p>

<p>Several of the other boys nodded and showed
willingness to agree with Paul’s idea that they all
go home. They walked along as a group until one
by one the boys fell out to go home. Finally only
Paul and Ken were left. The two boys walked
side by side and Paul seemed exceedingly quiet
and preoccupied with his thoughts. Ken hesitated
to break in upon his friend, but finally he asked,
“What are you so quiet and thoughtful about?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t really thinking of anything,” the
other replied.</p>

<p>“We may as well go home, like the others,”
suggested Ken.</p>

<p>“No, let’s not do that. Suppose we walk down
Main Street a bit. To tell you the truth, I am a
bit worried about Jack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Worrying won’t help any,” Ken wisely remarked.</p>

<p>The boys walked down Main Street and then
retraced their steps. At Paul’s house, they silently
sat down on the steps of the porch and remained
like that, neither one uttering a sound.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">A Suspicious Individual</span></p>

<p>Now let us see what really happened to Jack.
He left his home with the intention of going to
the meeting. As he walked along, deeply occupied
with his thoughts, he suddenly became conscious
of a certain individual that had just passed. Jack
turned on his heel and stared at the retreating
back of the individual. The man was tall and thin&mdash;gaunt;
he wore a cap and a jacket and pants
that hung like sacks upon him. Jack tried to think
what it was about the individual that attracted
his attention and he concluded that it was something
wild about his appearance, about his bearing.
He began to follow the man, sorry that he
did not get a good look at the man’s face.</p>

<p>Jack went over the situation in his mind. He
wanted to go to the meeting and if he did not
come, the boys might feel badly. On the other
hand, there was something very suspicious about
the person he was following. The man appeared
to be very excited, or anxious; he seemed to be
very much on the alert, turning his head this way
and that way, as though searching for something.
Jack felt sorry that he could not get a good look
at the man’s face. Perhaps he could do it now, he
thought, by walking ahead then walking back toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
him; or possibly by hiding in some doorway
and obtaining a close view of him as the man
passed. But on second consideration, he thought
it better not to do that. The man might get a good
look at him and remember his face, which would
put him at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Jack decided merely to follow and see what
would happen. Twice the man turned around and
looked back; Jack decided to cross over to the
other side of the street. His heart pounded and
he became nervous and excited. He followed,
keeping his eyes glued to the back of the suspicious
character. The man kept shifting his head
in all directions, staring at people, at houses, at
everything; his eyes seemed to bore right into
things.</p>

<p>The man turned into John Street, usually a
deserted street with only several old houses on it.
Jack quickly removed the light sweater he was
wearing and formed it into a small package under
his arm. If the man had noticed him, the fact that
he now appeared in a white shirt, carrying a package
under his arm, would make the man think him
a different person. The man continued walking
rapidly with Jack hot on his trail. The street was
very poorly lit and Jack was forced to shorten the
distance between the man and himself, though he
still kept to the wrong side of the street. Coming
to a lonely house set on a large plot, the man suddenly
dashed behind the wall. Jack felt his excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
increase. He was only sorry that Paul or
one of the boys were not with him; not that he
felt afraid but for the sake of companionship. He
had a weird, creepy feeling to be following a man
on a deserted, dark street.</p>

<p>Jack kept on walking as though nothing happened.
He made believe that he didn’t see anything
unusual. His head square on his shoulders,
he kept a careful watch out of the corner of his
eye. He saw a large rock on the lot he was passing
and immediately he threw himself behind it.
Looking from the side of his shelter, he watched
the house across the street. Possibly five minutes
passed and nothing happened. To him it seemed
like hours. At last the man he had been following
showed himself at the corner of the house. Warily,
the man stuck his head out and looked in all
directions. In spite of the distance between them,
the man’s wild appearance, his ghostly form outlined
in the dark, made Jack shiver; a cold chill
ran down his spine.</p>

<p>At last the man came forth and walked away
in the direction from which he had come. Waiting
until he thought it was safe for him to follow,
Jack then rose and sprinted forward until he was
within about five yards of his man, who no longer
shifted his head back and forth wildly but, instead
kept looking straight ahead of him. Jack was glad
of that because it made it easier following.</p>

<p>At Main Street, the man turned right. Jack followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and became more convinced that his suspicions
were well founded. Beyond any doubt
there was either something wrong with the man
or else he was a fugitive of some sort, trying to
get away. The man turned into Water Street and
Jack felt a cold chill break out. Instantly it flashed
upon him that the suspicious fire of the previous
day had occurred on Water Street. Was the man
returning to the place of his crime? Or was he on
his way to perpetrate another crime, perhaps set
flames to another house in the same neighborhood?</p>

<p>His head turned straight ahead of him, the
man walked on briskly. Jack followed. Closer and
closer they came to the house that had burned
down. When they were within about ten yards of
it, the man suddenly stopped in his tracks and
very slowly turned around. In the nick of time,
Jack dashed into a shadow and was out of sight.
The man hesitated and then very slowly approached
the heap of ashes and sticks of wood
that were once a house. Jack hid himself, watching
him closely, wondering what he was up to. Seeing
the man approach the heap of ashes, Jack’s emotions
got so strong that he could barely control
himself. “Easy!” he mumbled to himself. “Take
it easy now!”</p>

<p>He flattened himself out on the ground and
watched his man who sat down on the bare earth
as though in grief. The man’s shoulders heaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and soon Jack heard sobs of genuine sorrow. Jack
could not help feeling sorry for the poor chap. He
wondered what was wrong with him, that might
have caused him to set fire to the house. For by
now, Jack was no longer in any doubt as to the
man’s guilt.</p>

<p>For some time the man sat there, hunched over,
his body trembling and sobbing bitterly. At last
he got on his knees and crept forward to the heap
of ashes. Picking up a handful, he let the dust
slide through his fingers. Five or six times he repeated
this action. Finally he took out of his
pocket a handkerchief, spread it out on the
ground, and piled several handfuls of ashes on it;
then gathering the ends together, he made a knot
and put the package under his arm. Rising, he
looked around and then walked off in the direction
of Main Street.</p>

<p>Just as soon as he thought it was safe, Jack was
up and following. What was the most reasonable
thing to do, he tried to figure out. Should he
notify the police? Should he run off and talk it
over with Paul or Ken? Or should he do nothing
and just follow. Unable to determine what would
be his most reasonable action, he continued to
follow the man and thought of nothing else.</p>

<p>A block before Main Street, he saw his man
suddenly disappear into the side street. Becoming
frantic at the thought of losing him, Jack sprinted
up to the corner. He saw his man flattening out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
against the wall of the corner building. Jack hid
behind a parked car. Was the man aware of being
followed? Jack tried to think whether he had at
any moment shown himself. His deliberations
were cut short by the man stepping forth again
and continuing on his way. Pursuer and pursued
turned left on Main Street. The man increased his
pace, stretching out his long legs. However, Jack
had no difficulty in following. Clear across the
town the two went, back to John Street into which
the man turned. Jack hesitated for a second before
crossing the street. There was something funny
about being led back to this deserted street. Could
it be possible that he was being led into a trap of
some sort? Chucking his anxiety and doubt to the
winds, he crossed the street to follow, but by then
the man had disappeared. He walked up and
down the street but the man did not return.</p>

<p>Jack returned to Main Street. “Whew!” He
wiped the perspiration off his brow. That was
some night, some chase, he thought to himself.
The next moment he felt a pang of regret for
having lost track of his man. However, it could
not be helped and it would be useless to worry
over it. Now that he had a pretty good picture of
the individual&mdash;even though he had not seen the
face&mdash;Jack felt certain that he would come upon
him again. In the meanwhile he thought it best to
go over and see Paul.</p>

<p>Paul and Ken were sitting on the steps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
porch. Side by side, in silence, each mused over
his thoughts. Paul noticed someone approach the
gate. The next moment he was on his feet and
running to meet his chum. “Jack!” he cried,
“where have you been?”</p>

<p>Ken also ran up. “Hey!” he spoke harshly,
“you had us in stitches. What is the idea of disappearing
like that and where have you been?”</p>

<p>Jack smiled. “I am sorry I had you fellows
worried,” he said. “But wait until I tell you what
happened to me.”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Paul impatiently.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down first; I’m tired.”</p>

<p>The boys sat down at the rear of the porch, so
as not to be disturbed. Jack told his story and
Paul and Ken listened gravely, interrupting every
once in a while for some detailed information.
They sat so closely together, listened so attentively
to the narrative, that an outsider seeing
them would have taken them for conspirators. In
a sense they were that: they were conspiring on
how to capture and rid the neighborhood of a
maniac. When Jack had at last concluded, Ken
let out a long whistle. Paul whispered, “That
proves all my suspicions.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Ken. “Let’s re-consider
the whole situation. Both of you seem to have the
impression that the man is a maniac, crazy. But
how do you know that he didn’t contrive the whole
thing just to put on a show for Jack’s sake? How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
do you know what the man was up to? He might
have realized that he was being followed and to
mislead Jack, he performed a mighty interesting
show. We don’t know whether this man is guilty
of burning down that house and before we are
sure of it, let’s not pass judgement.”</p>

<p>There was silence. Those statements provided
plenty of food for thought and all three of them
knitted their brows. Paul said, “What you say
is true, Ken. Of course, we must not pass judgement
hastily. However, somehow I feel that my
suspicions are correct.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded. “I feel the same way about it,”
he offered as his opinion.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” argued Ken, “let’s wait and see.
You say that you would recognize him if you saw
him again&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” asserted Jack interrupting. “I
could pick him out of a million men.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. In that case, we will watch
out for him. In the meanwhile, I suggest that the
first thing tomorrow morning we go over to
Water Street and examine the place. Perhaps we
will find some sort of clue, his footprints if nothing
else.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we can’t go there tonight,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“No. For one thing, it is too late. And secondly
if someone noticed us there tonight, we would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
under suspicion. And that would make everything
perfect.”</p>

<p>“That’s settled, then,” remarked Ken as he
rose. “I am going home. Coming, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Goodnight, Paul.”</p>

<p>“Goodnight. See you fellows tomorrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Righto!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">The Spy</span></p>

<p>The following morning, immediately after
breakfast, the three boys met and set off for
Water Street. At the scene of the fire, Jack
pointed out the approximate spot where the man
had sat and wept. Searching for footprints, they
found many, most of them indistinct and smudged.
They continued their search for other possible
clues but found none. In the midst of their searchings,
however, Paul looking up thought he saw a
flitting shadow duck behind a fence across the
street. Making believe that he saw nothing, he
bent over and continued his investigations; however,
he had his eyes glued to the spot. And sure
enough, he saw a head protrude. He was amazed.
Was it possible that someone was spying on them?
Was it possible that the person Jack had followed
the evening before had now turned around and
was following them?</p>

<p>He called the two boys over. Pretending that
he was explaining to them the outline of a footprint,
he told them in a few words, of his discovery.
“Don’t look now,” he warned his friends;
“and don’t both look at the same time.”</p>

<p>Ken joked, saying, “I hope this thing hasn’t got
you so that you are beginning to see things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be funny,” remarked Paul seriously.
“Suppose you fellows move off now. Keep an eye
on the spot I pointed out to you and don’t give
yourselves away.”</p>

<p>The boys separated and pretended to be absorbed
in their investigations. They kept this up
for about five minutes and then Paul called them
and they walked away. “Well?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Jack nodded. “You are right,” he whispered.
“I also saw the head protruding from behind the
fence watching us.”</p>

<p>“What about you, Ken? Did you see
anything?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but
I am not as eagle-eyed as you two. I saw nothing
suspicious.”</p>

<p>“But I saw him watching us several times,” insisted
Paul.</p>

<p>“I saw him only once,” added Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, you two may be right and I wrong,”
commented the third companion.</p>

<p>“Who do you think it could be?” asked Jack.
“And what do you think his purpose is?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?”</p>

<p>“Do you think it is that man I followed last
night?”</p>

<p>Paul hesitated for a moment then shook his
head. “No, and I will tell you why. The person
you followed last night was tall and gaunt. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
individual appeared to me to be about average
height and robust. I could tell that from the
shadow.”</p>

<p>“Shall I turn around and see if we are being
followed?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that,” warned Paul. “He might
catch on that we know we are being followed. I
have a better plan.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“When we get to Main Street, you, Ken, will
turn right, wave to us, make believe as though you
are saying goodbye. Jack and I will turn left and
pretend that we are going home. But instead of
actually walking off, Ken, you will dash into a
doorway and watch to see if anyone is following
us.”</p>

<p>“And if there is?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Then you will follow him, naturally,” was
Paul’s answer.</p>

<p>“And if there is not?”</p>

<p>“Then you will take a roundabout route and
meet us in my house in about half an hour.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll do that.”</p>

<p>At Main Street, the group parted, one boy
walking off in one direction, while the other two
headed in the opposite direction. Ken, just as
soon as he parted from his companions, walked
to the second store from the corner, a haberdashery,
and stared at the window display.
Actually, however, his eyes were roaming elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and he was carefully watching the corner.
Some people came out of Water Street, but by the
look on their faces, by their general appearance
and by the fact that they seemed to know exactly
which way their direction lay, Ken knew that it
was not any one of them. Suddenly he caught his
breath. A robust man of medium height emerged
from the street and paused at the corner. He wore
a light jacket and a Panama hat, the brim pulled
down over his forehead.</p>

<p>After standing hesitantly on the corner, he
turned left, seemingly bent on following Paul and
Jack. Ken crossed the street and followed. The
chase continued for several blocks, the man increasing
his pace and Ken doing likewise. The
two boys were just ahead, crossing Chestnut
Street. As the man came to the corner, he turned.
Ken stopped at a corner store and looked at the
window display. He watched the man walk to the
middle of the block and then turn into the yard
of a private house. Ken scratched his head and
wondered.</p>

<p>The two boys were awaiting him. As Ken came
up the walk to the porch, Paul asked, “Well?”</p>

<p>Ken nodded meaningfully and the two boys
were re-assured of their suspicions. Joining his
companions, he muttered, “This man hunt is getting me.
I’m afraid that before it is all over I am
going to go crazy.”</p>

<p>“Why? What’s the matter?” inquired Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know who was following us?” Ken
put the question very gravely and looked from
one boy to the other.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Captain Bob.”</p>

<p>The announcement came as a shock, almost
overwhelming them. Each boy searched the face
of the other for some meaning or understanding.
But all of them were just as puzzled. Paul repeated the name,
“Captain Bob! But why should
he follow us?”</p>

<p>Ken shrugged his shoulders. “Are you sure it
was he?” questioned Jack, his demeanor grave
and serious.</p>

<p>“I am absolutely positive. After all, I know the
man. It’s true I didn’t see his face&mdash;”</p>

<p>Paul jumped. “You didn’t see his face!” he exclaimed.
“Then how do you know it was he? You
might be mistaken.”</p>

<p>Ken shrugged his shoulders. “Very possible,”
he said, “but I am pretty sure I am not mistaken.
To begin with, I know the man and I can recognize
him without seeing his face. And secondly,
I watched him walk down Chestnut Street and
enter a house at about the middle of the street.
That is where he lives, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but are you sure he walked into his own
house&mdash;that is, Captain Bob’s house?” demanded
Paul.</p>

<p>“Well, no, I didn’t follow him all the way to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
home; I watched from the corner. But just the
same I am pretty sure that it was Captain Bob.”</p>

<p>There was silence. The boys could not understand
why the Captain should follow them. “Well,
I’ll be!” exclaimed Jack. “This thing is getting
beyond me and I am losing my patience.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t get excited,” cautioned Paul. “And
keep quiet for a couple of minutes. I am trying to
think of something.”</p>

<p>“Think of what?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Of what he said to us when we were over to
see him,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“What about it?”</p>

<p>Paul leaned over toward his two companions.
“Now look, fellows,” he began. “There is one
particular thing he told us that comes back to me
now very distinctly. You remember how just as
we were leaving, he said to us, ‘Don’t you go
around talking about a pyromaniac; it may get
you into trouble.’ Remember him saying that?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded. “Yes, I remember.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Ken, “now that you call
our attention to it. But what about it? He meant
it for our own good.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Paul, “I am not doubting his
sincerity. But, Captain Bob is much shrewder than
we give him credit for, that’s the point.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” inquired Jack.</p>

<p>“We came over to talk over with him the fire,
didn’t we?” continued Paul. “Well, remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that he didn’t seem to have a very definite opinion
though he did feel that there was something odd
about the cause or origin of the fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your point?” demanded Ken, his
curiosity aroused.</p>

<p>“Only this,” said Paul, “that since we told him
of our own doubts about the fire and that since
we told him we suspected a pyromaniac, he immediately
came to the conclusion that we knew
more than we were telling him. And in order to
find out what we may know about the fire, he is
following us.”</p>

<p>“Sounds logical to me,” muttered Jack.</p>

<p>Ken shook his head. “It may sound logical,”
he said, “but somehow I am not convinced. How
should he know we were going out to Water
Street this morning? And he would have to watch
the house of any one of us three all morning to
follow us. And why should he pick this morning
to follow us?”</p>

<p>Paul smiled at his friend’s naive questions. “To
begin with,” he said, “how do we know he has not
been following us since that night we spoke to
him? But I am under the impression that his following
us is just an accident.”</p>

<p>“An accident!” echoed Jack. “Explain yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will if you don’t interrupt. My impression is
that he was coming to Water Street this morning
also to search for some clues to the fire. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he saw us there, he naturally watched us to see
what we were up to and then followed us.”</p>

<p>Ken shook his head in a gesture of disbelief.
Jake, on the other hand mused quietly, trying
to untangle the whole situation, but unable to find
a starting point. Finally he asked, “Do you think
he will continue to follow us, Paul?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell. He may and he may not.”</p>

<p>After a short time of silence, Jack rose and suggested,
“Well, let’s go home for lunch.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bully idea,” cried Ken. “I didn’t
realize how hungry I am.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll see you boys later,” said Paul.</p>

<p>That evening, immediately after supper, Paul
went across the street to call for Ken. As the two
boys walked down the street, Paul whispered,
“We are being followed.”</p>

<p>Ken gasped. “Captain Bob!” he exclaimed in a
hushed tone of voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. But for the last half hour I noticed
that someone was hovering about the house.
And as we came out and walked away, I noticed a
form slink out of the shadows and follow us.”</p>

<p>“What do you think we ought to do?”</p>

<p>“I have an idea.” And he whispered some instructions
to his friend.</p>

<p>Ken nodded. “And then what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Leave the rest to me.”</p>

<p>When the two boys arrived in front of Jack’s
home, Paul spoke up rather loudly, “I guess I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
walk down the block and call Nuthin’. I’ll be back
in about five minutes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Ken just as loudly. “Jack
and I will wait for you.”</p>

<p>Ken entered the yard while Paul walked off
straight ahead. Turning in at the end of the
street, he set off at a run around the block.</p>

<p>Returning to the same street at the other end,
he hovered close to the wall of a building and
looked everywhere to detect the hiding place of
the spy. Suddenly he caught his breath. He detected
a slight movement behind a fence at the
other side of the street, several houses below. He
crossed to the other side and walked ahead. Sure
enough, a man stepped out and came toward him.
As they met, Paul greeted, “Hello, Captain Bob.”</p>

<p>The man grunted and was going to pass on, but
Paul instantly got into his way. The man stopped,
“Huh?” he muttered. “Did you speak to me?”</p>

<p>“I said hello, Captain Bob.”</p>

<p>“Hello yourself. Now let me see, your face
seems to be familiar, but I can’t seem to remember
your name.”</p>

<p>“Paul Morrison.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes. You are the boy who dashed into
the burning house and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Paul interrupted. “Yes, that’s right; you know
me.” What a poor actor the man was, Paul
thought. He certainly couldn’t get away with pretending
that he didn’t know him. His heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
pounded and perspiration gathered on his brow.
He was debating with himself what his approach
should be. Would it be best merely to imply that
Captain Bob’s spying was a known fact to them or
should he put it frankly to the old man and see
what he would say. Paul steeled himself. Very
suddenly, trying to take the man off his guard,
he said, “Captain Bob, I am very much surprised
that you should be following us.”</p>

<p>The old man straightened up. “What was
that you said? Following you? What for? Why
should I be following you, tell me that.”</p>

<p>“That is something you should tell me,” he replied
respectfully. “But you spied on us this morning
on Water Street and then followed us as far
as Chestnut Street. And just now you were following
us again.”</p>

<p>It was really too dark to tell, but Paul felt that
the old man had turned red and became confused.
“My dear boy,” he mumbled angrily, “You don’t
know what you are talking about.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t say that, Captain Bob. If I
wasn’t positive, I wouldn’t accost you like this.”</p>

<p>After a moment of tense silence, the captain
laughed. “Well, my boy,” he said, “you are right,
but I promise not to do it any more.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. But if you don’t mind, I wish you
would tell me why you are following us.”</p>

<p>Captain Bob replied gravely, “You see, my boy,
there have been too many fires in this town lately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
And when you and your friends came and talked
to me about the fire the other day, I became a
little suspicious. I tried to,&mdash;er,&mdash;get as much information
out of you as I could, but somehow I
felt that you were not telling me everything. So I
thought I would check up on you.”</p>

<p>A feeling of relief swept over Paul. He wanted
to jump into the air and shout for joy. Even
though he was a modest boy, he had to pat himself
on the back; thus far, all his suspicions and
deductions had been correct. He would certainly
make a good detective. The captain was waiting
for him to say something and he commented,
“But we really don’t know any more than we
told you, Captain Bob. If there is anything the
boys and I can do to help you, such as help check
up on your suspicions&mdash;that is if you have any&mdash;we
would be glad to do so.”</p>

<p>The old man chuckled. “You are a smart one,
my boy. I know that you have something up your
sleeve. But never mind.”</p>

<p>Paul felt his face going red. He must not give
anything away, he thought. Out loud, he said,
“But really, Captain, we don’t. We don’t know as
much as you do, if as much.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind. And,&mdash;er,&mdash;forget about
my following you. I meant no harm.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of that,” replied the boy. “And it is
perfectly all right.”</p>

<p>“Good night, my boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good night, Captain Bob.”</p>

<p>Paul watched the man disappear around the
corner. And just as he started to cross the street,
two figures darted out toward him, “Well?” cried
Ken.</p>

<p>Paul put a finger to his lips. “Sh!” he cautioned.</p>

<p>The boys retreated to Jack’s garage where Paul
told his companions the story. Just as soon as the
narrative was completed, Ken cried, “The sly old
fox! You know, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if
he continues to spy on us.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I was going to say,” agreed
Paul. “He is a very shrewd man and I am positive
that he suspects somehow.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that he suspects us of
setting fire to that house?” inquired Jack
seriously.</p>

<p>“No, not setting fire to the house,” answered
Paul smiling. “That is ridiculous and we must
give him more credit than that. My impression is
that he suspects us of knowing something about it
which we are holding back from him. And that
happens to be true.”</p>

<p>“Providing, of course, that our suspicions are
correct,” argued Ken, still a bit doubtful.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, under those conditions.”</p>

<p>“What do you think our next move should be?”
questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to the movies,” suggested Ken.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” reasoned Paul. “Captain Bob
won’t follow us tonight any more&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which makes it safe for us to go to the
movies,” joked Ken.</p>

<p>The boys laughed. “Seriously, though,” said
Paul, “there is nothing else for us to do tonight.
That man was abroad last night, and it is reasonable
to assume that he won’t do any more prowling
around tonight.”</p>

<p>“I agree with that wholeheartedly,” said Ken.
“Let’s go to the movies.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">The Robbery</span></p>

<p>The following morning, at the breakfast table,
Paul happened to glance at the front page of the
<i>Stanhope Herald</i> which Dr. Morrison was reading.
At the bottom of the page, boxed off, was a
story with the headline PROFESSOR LINK’S
HOUSE ROBBED. Paul became quite upset and
found it difficult to eat his cereal. However, he
controlled himself and did not show any untoward
interest in the newspaper. His father finished
breakfast first, and he laid down the paper and
left for his office. Paul gulped down his milk,
picked up the paper and went out on the porch.</p>

<p>The story was that someone had broken into
Professor Link’s home and had stolen a valuable,
early edition of “Colonial History.” Nothing else
was taken, except that the thief had strewn many
of the books on the floor. The theory was that
the thief had entered by an open window in the
library.</p>

<p>Ken came dashing across the street and up to
the porch. “Hey, Paul!” he cried, “did you read
the story in the morning paper?” Paul held up
the paper. “So you know already?”</p>

<p>Jack came. “Well, what do you think of the
robbery?” he asked bluntly. “I had a feeling we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
should not have gone to the movies last night.”</p>

<p>“What could we have done?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“We might have come upon him and possibly
frustrated his plan.”</p>

<p>“So!” exclaimed Ken. “You think that ‘he’
did it? Pretty soon you will have every crime
under the sun charged up against him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we could have done anything,”
commented Paul. “The paper says that the robbery
occurred any time after about midnight,
when the professor says he left his library to go
to bed.”</p>

<p>“But we might have come across him sometime
before and followed him. Then we might about
have judged what he was up to.” Thus argued
Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe yes and maybe no,” was Paul’s pert
statement.</p>

<p>“Paul,” demanded Ken, “you don’t mean to
tell me that you really believe this man, this so-called
maniac, committed the robbery, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, how do you figure it out?”</p>

<p>“It’s very simple,” was Paul’s answer. “Only
one book was stolen. Of course, the book was an
old edition and valuable, but valuable only to a
man like Professor Link. In actual money, the
book is worth perhaps ten or fifteen dollars; but
if the thief was going to sell it, he wouldn’t get
more than four or five dollars for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” added Jack, “there were more valuable
things in the room, if the thief had been interested
in stealing something valuable. That is in
itself enough to show that the thief, whoever
he was, was either a maniac or one who was interested
in obtaining only that book and nothing
else. But an ordinary, normal man, would not
break into a house to steal something like that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” remarked Ken doubtfully, “but&mdash;”</p>

<p>Paul interrupted, saying, “Let’s go over to Bobolink
and get him to go over to Professor Link.
He is Bobolink’s grandfather, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Let’s do that.”</p>

<p>The boys wended their way to Bobolink’s home
and luckily found him still in. He was glad to see
them, and commented, “I was just going to call
you fellows.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I thought that perhaps you might be interested
in accompanying me to my grandfather’s
home.”</p>

<p>“That’s why we came for you,” Jack informed
him.</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll be with you in a minute.”</p>

<p>Professor Link who lived alone except for a
woman who cooked and kept house for him, was a
retired college professor and an authority in colonial
history. He occupied a small, private house of
his own and spent his time writing books on the
history of the early pioneering days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>His three companions behind him, Bobolink
rang the bell. The housekeeper opened the door.
“Good morning, Mrs. Hix,” greeted Bobolink.
“Is my grandfather in?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hix answered, “He is in the library.”</p>

<p>The boys filed in and Bobolink knocked on the
library door. “Come in,” someone called.</p>

<p>The boys entered. Mr. Link was a gray haired
man of about sixty with a warm smile, who was
very friendly to young people. “Hello, Gramps,”
greeted Bobolink.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows,” returned the professor.
“What are you doing here?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Just thought we would pay you a visit,” his
grandson informed him.</p>

<p>“That’s very nice of you, but I wonder what
is behind it. Sit down, boys.”</p>

<p>The walls of the room were lined with books.
And it appeared that the mess that the thief had
caused was all cleaned up. “What about that robbery,
Gramps?” asked Bobolink.</p>

<p>Paul was walking around the room, pretending
to be looking at the books. Actually he was searching
for something. He paused to hear the professor’s
answer to the question. “Not much harm
done.”</p>

<p>“Was it a valuable book?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Not so particularly valuable; a book on colonial
history.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather odd that the thief should take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that particular book and nothing else?” asked
Paul casually.</p>

<p>Professor Link pursed his lips. “Rather,” he
answered. “If he had been out to steal, he could
have found more valuable things to take. He
might even have found some money in the drawer
of my desk, if he had looked.”</p>

<p>“But nothing else was touched?” Paul asked
the question and was anxious to hear the answer.
“No. Nothing else seems to have been taken.”
Bobolink and Ken discussed with the professor
the state university to which they were going, entering
as freshmen in September. Paul walked
around the back of the desk. He glanced down
into the waste-paper basket. His heart almost
stopped still. He picked something out of the basket
and said to the professor, “Do you mind if I
use this to copy down the name of a book?”
Professor Link looked at the card. “Not at
all. Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“In the waste basket.” Paul turned the card to
show that it was blank on both sides.</p>

<p>The boys stared at Paul and at the white card.
“Here is some clean paper,” the professor said,
and pushed forward a white pad. “And here is a
pencil,” he added.</p>

<p>“This is perfectly all right,” asserted Paul.
Picking up the pencil, he pretended that he was
copying down the title of a book.</p>

<p>The boys were eager to get out, yet they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
not very well show haste without making the professor
suspicious. So they lingered for an additional
twenty minutes, discussing colleges and college life.
At last they escaped. As soon as they
were outside the door, Bobolink opened his mouth
to ask a question. But Paul cautioned him. “Sh!
Let’s wait until we are further away from the
house.”</p>

<p>Some distance away, Bobolink finally asked his
question. “What was that card you picked out of
the basket?”</p>

<p>Paul took it out of his pocket and showed it to
them&mdash;a white card, blank on both sides, and
three by two inches. “You have your card, Jack?”
asked Paul. “Mine is home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, here it is.” And he produced it.</p>

<p>The cards were compared; they were identical.
“Well, now what do you think of that!” exclaimed
Bobolink.</p>

<p>“In every case,” whispered Paul seriously, “the
same person. This is becoming terrible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ken. “I’m coming to look at it
from your point of view. And from now on we
have to take it more seriously and do something.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Bobolink.</p>

<p>“You know what?” remarked Paul. “If I didn’t
think we would be laughed at, I would tell the
police.”</p>

<p>“Aw, go on,” said Ken. “If all the evidence you
have is the white card and the fact that Jack followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a suspicious looking person, they would
think that you were either crazy or trying to put
something over.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” asserted Paul. “In that
case it is up to us to solve the mystery and put
an end to it.”</p>

<p>“Well said,” commented Bobolink, “but how
are we going to do it?”</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Encounter</span></p>

<p>The boys did not know what to do nor how to
do it. But they were determined to put an end to
the mystery. And shortly, too. If the man was
permitted to roam the streets of the town freely,
God knows what damage he might eventually do
and what crimes he might have up his sleeve. He
might lead away another child, he might commit
more robberies, he might put the torch to a house
full of sleeping persons, he might do anything.
He had to be caught; upon that the boys were
firmly convinced.</p>

<p>That evening, Jack came to Paul and said,
“Listen, I’m going to tell my mother that I am
having supper at your house tonight. But instead,
I am going down to Jones Street and nose around
a bit.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. But suppose I go with you.”</p>

<p>“No, I would rather go down alone. It is too
difficult for two people to be hiding together, darting
in and out, and all that.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Jack. Be careful, though. Don’t
get into any trouble. I feel guilty letting you go
alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk like an old woman.” The boys
laughed at that. “I can take care of myself. I have
done it before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well, go ahead. But I want you to come
back and tell what happens.”</p>

<p>“All right. But if nothing happens, I won’t
come. I will go home instead.”</p>

<p>Thus it was agreed and the two boys parted.
Half an hour later, Jack was at the corner of
Main and Jones Streets. It was still daylight and
Jack had the opportunity to look the neighborhood
over. It was a poor and deserted neighborhood,
not far from the edge of the town. The first
building on the corner was an old wooden house.
At the street level was a grocery store, and the
floor above looked as though it were occupied by
a family.</p>

<p>Alongside this building was an empty lot, as
was true of the opposite corner. Further on, intermittently
on both sides of the street were one or
two family wooden homes. Jack walked up and
down the block twice. There were some women on
several of the porches and a number of children
played on the empty lots. He decided to take up
a position at the corner of Jones and Main
Streets, but it was still light and he didn’t want to
arouse any suspicion. So it became a problem as
to how to spend the hours until dark.</p>

<p>First he walked up and down the block several
times, then went around the block twice until he
was afraid that people in the neighborhood might
become suspicious of him. Then he walked up
Main Street and back again. It seemed to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that the day would never end. He crossed the
street to the empty lot and walked to the farthest
corner of it. Picking out a comfortable place to
sit down, where he would not be noticed, he tried
to watch the corner so as to see everyone who
passed.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged on endlessly. What is the
matter, Jack asked himself. Time usually passes
so quickly; before you turn around the day is
gone. And now&mdash;He shifted in his seat and found
the ground hard to sit on. Staring vaguely at the
house on the corner, at the few people that passed
up and down, many thoughts came to his mind.
The uppermost thought in his mind was, what
might be wrong with this man, the maniac? It was
something he wished he knew, as he had always
been interested in trying to figure out what made
people do the things they did.</p>

<p>But that thought soon slipped his mind and
was replaced by another one&mdash;that of going to
college. Another three weeks and the summer vacation
would be over and Ken, Bobolink, Paul and
he would be on their way to the state university.
What was college life like, he wondered. There
were sports, of course. Ken would make a
swell swimmer and Paul would most likely join
the football squad. As for himself, he would try
basketball. Then there were the fraternities. He
had heard a lot about Greek letter clubs. But he
was not going to bother much with any outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
activities; he was going to study to be a doctor.
So was Paul. And it took a lot of study to become
a doctor.</p>

<p>He was staring rather aimlessly. His dreaming
helped to pass the time away. It was already almost
dusk. Suddenly he was electrified. He jumped
to his feet and then he dropped to the ground
again. A tall individual had just then emerged
from the door of the corner house. Bending low,
he ran to the corner and caught sight of the retreating
back of his man. A cold chill ran down
his spine. He was certain of his man. There was
the same height, the same baggy clothes and that
wild appearance. The man kept shifting his head
in all directions; his eyes seemed to be everywhere,
staring at people, at houses, at everything.</p>

<p>Jack followed closely. It was still not quite dark
and he hoped he would not be stopped by anyone.
He was rather glad when the man turned into
York Street. It was a quiet, residential street and
instantly Jack feared what the man might be up
to. Was he bent on starting a fire in one of the
fine houses on the street? But his fears were in
vain because the man kept on walking, almost
reaching the tracks. Repeating his gestures of the
day before, the man suddenly stopped and very
slowly turned around on his heel. Jack had just
enough time to dash behind a fence. The man
entered the yard and then walked behind the
house. Jack ran up and hid himself behind a tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
almost directly across from the house. Looking
closely, he noticed that the house appeared to be
unoccupied. There were no lights in the windows
and there was nothing to indicate that anyone
lived there. The man reappeared and entered the
house by the front door. He just walked in without
using any key, or breaking in the lock. There
was something suspicious about the house. If it
were unoccupied, it should be locked. If a family
did live there, there would be some light in the
windows; and probably the maniac would not enter
so assured of his safety.</p>

<p>It seemed to Jack that the man was in the house
a long time. He decided on a dangerous tactic.
Quickly, noiselessly, he sprinted across the street,
jumped the fence and ran to the side of the house.
Cautiously, he moved to see if there was a back
door; he found it on the other side of the house.
Putting his hand on the knob, he turned it and
pushed, but the door wouldn’t open; it was locked.
He moved toward the front again, to watch for
the exit of his man. Every second was an eternity.
His heart pounded wildly and if he had not controlled
himself, he would have trembled, not so
much from fear as from anxiety and excitement.</p>

<p>He flattened himself out against the wall and
remained stationary, not daring to make a noise.
Suddenly he felt long, bony fingers grab him by
the shoulder and wheel him around. His blood
went cold and he could almost feel his hair standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on end. “So!” the man grunted under his
breath. “What are you doing, following me, eh?”
Jack cowered before the great height towering
over him. He saw that the man had a rising forehead,
bushy eyebrows and deep eye sockets. What
impressed him most, however, were the man’s
sunken cheeks and his wild eyes, which were dark
and brilliant.</p>

<p>For almost a minute, Jack was paralyzed and
couldn’t talk. Eventually he muttered, “No&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;I’m
not following you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are,” accused the man. “You have
been following me for two weeks now and I want
you to stop it.”</p>

<p>Jack heaved a sigh of relief. The man was
crazy. But was he dangerous, he wondered.
Would he attack him. He was on guard against
an attack. “Why, no, Mister, I’m not following
you. Why should I? I don’t even know you.”</p>

<p>“You lie!” screamed the other. “You lie! You
do know me and I know you.”</p>

<p>Jack thought he had better be quiet and polite
with his assailant. A good, sound argument might
get him out of his predicament, he thought. “I am
sorry, Mister,” he said, “but I repeat that I don’t
know you. If you know me, as you say you do,
then what is my name.”</p>

<p>Still holding on to Jack’s shoulder, the man
scratched his chin. “Now let me see,” he mumbled
to himself. “What is your name?” He mused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
then he snapped his fingers and announced, “I
know. It’s Jack.”</p>

<p>The boy gasped. How could that man know
him, know his name. What was he to do? He
wished he had never known about this thing,
had never followed this man and had never got
into this situation. Controlling himself, he asked,
“What is my family name?”</p>

<p>“Barrows!” the man snapped back. “Barrows,
that’s it.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” contradicted Jack. “My
name is Ed Smith.”</p>

<p>“No,” insisted the man, “you are Jack Barrows.
And I demand to know why you are following
me.”</p>

<p>“But I am not following you. You are
mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you doing here?” The man’s
voice now boomed. “Tell me that!”</p>

<p>“I used to live in this house,” fabricated unhappy
Jack. “I once used to live here,” he repeated,
“and I was just looking around.”</p>

<p>“So you used to live here!”</p>

<p>The man lifted his free arm and swung. Jack
ducked. The arm crashed against the wall, the
man screamed with pain and Jack wrenched himself
free. The man lunged for him. Jack side-stepped
and stuck his foot out; his victim tripped and
stretched himself out on the ground. Without
waiting or looking back, Jack was off. He jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the fence and dashed down the street. Rounding
the corner, he stopped to consider why he was running.
He stood nonchalantly and waited for his
man to appear. But the mysterious individual was
not forthcoming. He waited five more minutes
and still he did not appear.</p>

<p>He came around the corner again and crossed
to the other side of the street. Walking slowly
and cautiously, he came to the tree opposite the
house. Taking shelter, Jack looked across. A wave
of pity swept through him at the scene he saw.
On the very same spot, almost where he fell, the
man was now sitting up and his shoulders were
trembling. From all appearances, the man was
sobbing bitterly, as though his heart were
breaking.</p>

<p>Who is this man, Jack asked himself. And
what is the matter with him? What had ever happened
to him to cause him to become what he was.
Jack asked himself all those questions but had no
answers. He determined to find out. He must find
out, he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Jack looked at his watch and saw that it was
almost nine o’clock. He realized that he was terribly
hungry. He decided not to wait around any
more but to go home. On the way he remembered
that he had promised Paul that he would come
over and tell him if anything had happened. But
he did not feel like it at the moment and he went
straight home and called Paul on the telephone.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Who Is Mr. Grey?</span></p>

<p>Paul and Ken were listening attentively to
Jack’s story of what had happened the night before.
Paul commented, “It’s really a pity. What
we have to do is to catch him in the act as soon
as possible and have him arrested. Then something
might be done for him.”</p>

<p>“What could be done for him?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Most likely he would be
put into an asylum. That would be best, too, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Jack showed his companions the house to which
he followed his man the night before. There was
nothing much to see there. The place was empty
and unoccupied. But strangely, the front door was
open. They entered and searched about. All the
rooms were empty and dusty. In the hall again
Paul noticed some scraps of paper in one corner.
He looked at them but thought nothing suspicious
of it. He sniffed the air and then shook his head.</p>

<p>Outside again, they walked calmly off. “No
clues here, it seems,” muttered Ken.</p>

<p>“No,” asserted Paul. And again he thought of
the scraps of paper but the next moment dismissed
them from his mind. “What seems to bother me
most,” he added, “is how he came to suspect that
he was being followed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think he really suspected,” said Jack.
“My opinion is that he came upon me by
accident.”</p>

<p>“A very unhappy accident,” commented Ken.</p>

<p>“Yes, rather.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” remarked Paul. He shook
his head doubtfully. “Yet somehow I can’t quite
believe it. Of course, you’re most likely right,
but&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off his sentence in the middle, not
quite decided upon his opinion. Jack thought out
loud. “I wonder who this man is and what is
wrong with him?”</p>

<p>“You say there is a grocery store at the corner
house, is that right?” The boys stopped and Jack
nodded. “Then,” continued Ken, “let’s go down
there and inquire in a roundabout way in the store.
They might know him.”</p>

<p>“That’s a swell idea,” cried Paul.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so too,” added Jack. “Let’s do
it.”</p>

<p>They walked down to Jones Street. A very
short distance before they arrived at their destination,
they stopped to decide upon their plan of
action. “Exactly how are we going to do it?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“One of us will have to go inside and make a
purchase, then ask about a tall dark-complexioned
man.”</p>

<p>“I guess one of you two better go in. They may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
have noticed me around here and they might get
suspicious.”</p>

<p>“I will go in,” offered Ken. “But what am I to
say?”</p>

<p>“Just ask if they know a tall, dark man living
somewhere in the neighborhood,” instructed Paul.</p>

<p>“But if they ask me what I want him for, what
am I to say?”</p>

<p>“Make up some kind of story, anything. Say
that you were told that he was a plumber, or
something like that, and that you want him to do
a job.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll go in. Where are you fellows
going to be?”</p>

<p>“We will be right here. And when you come out,
just keep walking straight ahead as if you don’t
know us.”</p>

<p>“Okey, here goes.”</p>

<p>Ken walked off and came to the store. He hesitated,
looked around, pretending that he was not
certain it was the right place. He entered. He
noticed that a middle-aged woman was alone in
the store. She came out from behind the counter
and asked, “Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;excuse me,” he said, “but I am looking
for a tall, dark man. I was told that he lives in this
neighborhood somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I know a tall, dark man,” she answered, speaking
softly. “What is it you want him for, may I
ask?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was told he was a carpenter and looking for
work and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be Mr. Grey. He is not a carpenter.
You couldn’t mean him.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite all right.”</p>

<p>Ken left the store much excited. He walked
briskly till he came upon the boys. They fell in
alongside of him. “Well?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“His name is Mr. Grey,” gasped Ken.</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“That’s all. The woman did not tell me any
more.”</p>

<p>“But the name alone is not enough,” cried
Jack. “What does he do? Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t ask her such questions,” Ken defended
himself. “She would become suspicious and
tell me nothing.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not argue,” cautioned Paul. “At least
we have his name, that’s something. Did the
woman in the store seem to know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I should imagine from the way she spoke
that she knew him well.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t mention anything, else?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The boys walked silently along for some while.
Paul snapped his fingers. “You know what?” he
cried. “Let’s look him up in the town directory.”</p>

<p>“Where will we get one?” inquired Ken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have one home,” said Paul.</p>

<p>The boys hurried to the Morrison home and
Paul brought out the town directory. It didn’t
help them any. There were three Greys. One was
a pharmacist, the second was a butcher and the
third a lawyer. They put the book down and Jack
muttered, “That’s not much of a help.”</p>

<p>“No. It’s very possible that he has only recently
moved into town,” commented Paul.</p>

<p>“Now that is an idea,” remarked Ken. “The
reason he is so little known must be because he is
a newcomer around here.”</p>

<p>“But how does that help us any?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good to keep it in mind,” asserted
Ken.</p>

<p>“What do you say we go down to that neighborhood
again?” asked Jack, “and just look
around. Perhaps we can find some person who
knows something.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right with me,” was Paul’s comment.</p>

<p>The three boys shuffled off the porch and
walked down Main Street again. At Jones Street,
they could find no other stores in the immediate
neighborhood where they might enter and obtain
some information. They walked back and forth
several times, but their searches were futile. One
of them suggested that they quit and go home and
the others assented. Passing on the other side of
the street, the three of them kept their eyes on
the store. A woman emerged. Ken grasped Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
by the arm. “Look,” he said, “there’s the woman
leaving the store.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about her?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand?” demanded Ken. “She
is the woman I spoke to when I entered the
store.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” cried Jack. “If she is leaving,
someone else must be in the store. I am going in.
Perhaps I can obtain some information.”</p>

<p>Paul held on to his chum who was on the point
of walking off. “No,” he said. “I’m going in. You
may have been noticed around here before and it
would look suspicious. Both of you just keep walking
back and forth and don’t attract attention. I
am going in.”</p>

<p>Jack and Ken continued walking along Main
Street while Paul crossed over to the store and
entered. A customer was at the counter and Paul
pretended to be looking around. The customer
left and the man, evidently the proprietor, remained
behind the counter, waiting for Paul to
give his order. “Is there anything I can do for
you?” he asked.</p>

<p>Paul picked up a small box of chocolate crackers
and deposited a nickel on the counter. The
man picked up the coin and rang it up on the
register. “Excuse me, Mister, but it seems that a
certain Mr. Grey lives in this neighborhood
and....”</p>

<p>Paul did not finish his sentence. He scrutinized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the man’s features and concluded that the proprietor
of the grocery was a shrewd, hard, and
unsympathetic individual. He must be careful of
every word, he told himself. The man drawled,
“Now let me think.” He scratched his chin and
pretended that he was trying to remember an individual
by the name of Mr. Grey. “What is it
you want of him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” Paul began, “my mother
heard that he was a carpenter and she wants some
work done.” That was bad, he thought to himself.
It was the same story that Ken had used and
if his wife told him that some boy was in looking
for a carpenter, the man was sure to become suspicious.
But he was obliged now to stick to his
story. He continued, “So she sent me around here
to try and find him.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” the grocery man asked
him.</p>

<p>“Around the corner. The next street.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember ever seeing you around in
the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>Paul realized that he was in a predicament and
he had to get himself out of it. “We just moved
in, two weeks ago,” he answered.</p>

<p>The man scratched his chin again. “Isn’t that
strange?” he muttered. “I haven’t heard of anyone
moving in or out of the neighborhood within
the past two weeks.” He paused and eyed Paul
who felt his face going red. “Well, at any rate, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
am sorry but I don’t know any Mr. Grey around
here.”</p>

<p>Paul moved away from the counter. “Thank
you,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s quite all right. Tell your mother to come
in here sometime and do her shopping. I like to
know the people in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Paul was glad to escape from the store. He had
never before realized how difficult it is to obtain
information from people. Joining his companions,
he laughed good naturedly. “What’s the joke?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“The old so and so!” he exclaimed. “He got
more out of me than I got out of him.”</p>

<p>“You mean you didn’t find out anything?” Jack
was serious and anxious.</p>

<p>Paul shook his head. “Not a thing. The old
man beat around the bush and finally confessed
that he didn’t know anyone by the name of Mr.
Grey.”</p>

<p>“And you fellows accused me of not obtaining
enough information,” Ken joked. “At least I
found out what his name is.”</p>

<p>The boys were discouraged. “Now what?”
asked Jack in a tone of hopelessness.</p>

<p>His companions did not know what to do next
and rather than talk about it, they walked along
silently. They came to the street on which Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lived and he said he was going home. Ken said,
“No, don’t do that. It’s early yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought I would go home and putter
around with my dad’s car; it needs some work
done on it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” commented Ken. “Let’s go
over and speak to your father, Paul. He is a doctor
and knows a lot of people in town. Perhaps he
might tell us something.”</p>

<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders. “Yes, we can do
that. But I don’t think he has many patients in
this neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“And if he doesn’t know,” continued Ken, “we
might go over and see Chief of Police Bates. He
knows me and I am sure we could get to see him.”</p>

<p>Paul shook his head. “I don’t think we ought
to see Chief Bates. He might ask us a lot of questions,
worm the story out of us and then laugh at
us or call us crazy kids.”</p>

<p>“We might at least try your father,” insisted
Ken.</p>

<p>“All right. We will do that.”</p>

<p>But Dr. Morrison did not know either. He
mentioned John Grey, the pharmacist, Walter
Grey the butcher and W. J. Grey the lawyer.
Those were all the Greys he knew. But the boys
knew that themselves. They were stumped.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Stumped!</span></p>

<p>It was shortly after lunch time and Paul was
doing an errand for his father. Walking down
Main Street, he stopped at a stationery store to
look at the window display. His attention was
attracted by someone coming out of the store. He
caught his breath. The man was tall, gaunt, with
ill fitting clothes hanging like sacks on him. “Mr.
Grey!” he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Not hesitating, Paul followed. He wanted to
get a good look at the man’s face, but how was he
going to do that? He thought fast. Increasing his
pace, he walked past the man. At the corner, he
pretended that he was lost and was looking for
something. He waited for Mr. Grey to come up.
Approaching the man, he said, “Excuse me, sir.
But can you tell me where McDougal Street is?
You see, I am a stranger in this town.”</p>

<p>Paul looked up at the great height towering
over him. He was very much excited and kept
shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
Mr. Grey answered softly, “I’m sorry, son, but I
really don’t know.”</p>

<p>Paul pretended that he was disappointed. The
man’s sunken cheeks, long nose and deep sockets,
were imprinted in his mind. But it was Mr. Grey’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
eyes that bore into him. Those eyes! he thought to
himself, he would never forget them. They were
dark, brilliant, wild. He became conscious that
he was staring very awkwardly at the man and
that Mr. Grey was waiting for him to say something.
He said, “You see&mdash;er&mdash;I am looking for
Grey’s Pharmacy.”</p>

<p>The man repeated to himself, “Grey’s Pharmacy!
I am sorry, but I don’t think I know where
it is.”</p>

<p>On the spur of the moment, Paul said, “And
then I have to go down also to John and Main
Streets. Can you tell me where that is?”</p>

<p>Paul thought that the man would show some
sign of interest at the mention of the words Grey
and John Street. But he was disappointed. Mr.
Grey was quite calm and not at all disturbed by
those words. He answered softly, “Yes, I can tell
you where John Street is. You walk straight down
Main Street; you can’t miss it. It is quite a walk
though; almost a mile.” He hesitated for a second
and looked down the street. “There is the car
coming,” he continued. “You can take it and get
off at John Street.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” murmured Paul and stepped
aside to let the man pass on. He watched Mr. Grey,
walk away. Remembering that he still had the
errand to do for his father, he was undecided
whether to follow or not. Shaking his head, he
turned and walked off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Completing the errand for his father, he ran
off to the stationery store. He entered. A young
man behind the counter asked, “What can I do
for you?”</p>

<p>Paul showed him a blank, white card. “Have
you got any cards like that?” he asked.</p>

<p>The young man behind the counter took the
card, fingered it and answered, “Yes, we have
them. How many do you want?”</p>

<p>“I need ten,” said Paul.</p>

<p>The young man stopped as he was pulling out
a box from one of the shelves, and replied, “I’m
sorry. The cards are twenty-five cents a hundred
and we don’t sell less than a package of a
hundred.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, then,” announced Paul and
walked out of the store.</p>

<p>Paul felt cheerful; he seethed with excitement.
Now he was getting somewhere, he thought.
Upon reflection he realized that he was nowhere
nearer to a solution of the mystery than he was
before. Yet he could not dispel his feeling of
excitement.</p>

<p>He felt someone touch him on the arm and
Paul turned around. “Hello, Captain Bob,” he
called.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself, my boy,” was the reply.
“What are you doing just now?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. I am at your disposal, if you
want me to do something for you,” he offered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you to do anything for me,”
and the captain shook his head. “I merely want
to have a few words with you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right with me. What is it you
want?”</p>

<p>“Let’s first move away from the main thoroughfare,”
remarked Captain Bob, smiling. “We
may get knocked over by all these people rushing
past us.”</p>

<p>They walked away a short distance into Cherry
Street. Paul was curious to know what the captain
had to say to him. He was on his guard, though.
The old man was clever and shrewd and if he
thought he was going to obtain information from
him, he was mistaken. Paul steeled himself and
asked, “Is this all right? I guess we can talk here
without being disturbed.”</p>

<p>Captain Bob nodded. “Yes, I think so, too,”
he answered. “What I want to ask you, my boy,
is how are you getting along with solving that
mystery of yours?”</p>

<p>Paul gasped. He didn’t think the man would
put it up to him so bluntly. “What mystery?” he
asked, trying to make his voice sound as though
he were surprised at the question.</p>

<p>“Now, now,” commented the old man. “Never
mind beating around the bush. Let’s be honest
with each other. I suppose you know that I am
also interested in finding the culprit who is responsible
for starting that fire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is news to me,” replied Paul. “I didn’t
think you had any suspicions about the cause of
the fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know I did. And what’s more, I
also know that you and your friends are doing
a lot of detective work. I just want to know how
you are getting along and whether you have come
upon any substantial clues.”</p>

<p>Paul smiled, feeling slightly guilty. “As a matter
of fact,” he answered, “we have not been doing
much lately at all. And ...” he paused to suspend
the effect of the remark. “And we don’t
know any more now than we did when we spoke
to you about it.”</p>

<p>“Tsk, tsk.” Captain Bob appeared angry. “I
guess we will just have to wait and see what
happens.”</p>

<p>“If there is anything my friends and I can
do,” began Paul.</p>

<p>The captain cut him short. “Never mind,” he
said, “never mind. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Captain Bob walked off. Paul smiled to himself
and went home. All afternoon he brooded
over his problem. The mystery continued to be a
mystery to him. He wondered what Captain Bob
was up to, whether he was still following him and
his friends and also whether the old man was conducting
an investigation of his own. His father
came up the steps of the porch. “What are you
brooding about, son?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” was the answer. “Just
thinking.”</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison looked askance at his son.
“Well,” he commented, “let’s hope you are really
thinking and not pretending you are thinking.”</p>

<p>“W-w-what was that you said?” gasped Paul.</p>

<p>But Dr. Morrison laughed softly and walked
into the house. Paul got out of his seat and walked
off. Jack was busy tinkering with his father’s car.
He looked up and called out, “Hello, Paul. Anything
new?”</p>

<p>Paul sat down on the box of tools. “A little,”
he answered nonchalantly.</p>

<p>Jack wiped his greasy hands. “What do you
mean.”</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. Grey.” Jack opened his eyes wide
and stared at his friend. “And I spoke to him,
too,” he added.</p>

<p>Jack sat down on the running board. “Well,
go on, tell me. What happened?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Paul related the events. Jack listened attentively.
Finally he muttered, “So! Does all that
help any?”</p>

<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders. “Very little. But
at least I now have a good idea of the sort of
person he is.” A pause. “Captain Bob spoke to
me,” he announced.</p>

<p>“What does he want? How did you see him?”</p>

<p>“He stopped me in the street. He wants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
know what we are doing and how we are getting
along.”</p>

<p>“A shrewd, clever fellow, that Captain Bob,”
was Jack’s appraisal. “He is aware that we know
something which we won’t tell him and he is trying
to get it out of us.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering,” remarked Paul, “whether
it wouldn’t be better to tell him and see what
happens.”</p>

<p>“What good will that do?”</p>

<p>“None that I can see, but ...”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Let’s forget that angle of it and
think what to do?”</p>

<p>“I know what I am going to do,” announced
Jack.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The same as I did last night. I am going to
follow Mr. Grey.” He eyed his companion. “And
you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided yet. Guess I’ll go home
now.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">A Hunch</span></p>

<p>Paul, however, did not go home. On the way
he changed his mind and went to the library instead.
He went to the back of the room and pored
over the newspaper files of the past few months.
About an hour later he left the library. He had a
hunch which gave him a new track to work on. He
had a slip of paper in his hand and he looked on
the writing on it several times until he memorized
it. Then he tore the slip of paper into minute
scraps and disposed of it.</p>

<p>Immediately after supper, he went out of the
house and walked off. He had a definite destination
in mind. At Corral Street, which was two
blocks from Water Street, he set about looking
for a particular number. That led him about half
a mile away from the place of the former fire,
which coincided with his hunch. He came upon the
number he was looking for. The house was a two
story dwelling, set away from the sidewalk. At
the gate was a sign:</p>

<p class="pc1">
JONES &amp; JONES<br />
REALTORS<br />
HOUSE FOR RENT</p>

<p class="p1">Paul walked around the block and looked over
the neighborhood. It was a similarly poor section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the town. Coming back to the empty house, he
sneaked into the yard and walked to the rear of
the house. Unable to find a good location from
which he could watch anyone approaching or entering
the house, he retreated a short distance
and took up a position behind the gate and sheltered
by some shrubbery. From his vantage point,
he could not only see anyone approaching the
house, but also keep a sharp watch at those passing
along the street.</p>

<p>It was already dusk. Paul settled himself, getting
as comfortable as possible. There was nothing
else to do but wait and see. Perhaps his hunch
was a good one, and on the other hand, perhaps
a very poor one, he thought to himself. At any
rate, he had nothing to lose by going through
with it.</p>

<p>Time dragged on. He watched the sky become
grayer and darker. The moon rose and the first
star came out. Night came on gradually. In spite
of himself, he began to fidget and become impatient.
Was something going to happen or wasn’t
it? He went over in his mind the hunch that he
had and tried to figure out how reasonable it was.
At least to himself it appeared reasonable. He
wondered, however, what Jack or Ken might think
of it. It was no use doing that, he told himself, because
he had not spoken to them about it. The
next moment he was sorry he hadn’t done it. Two
heads, three heads are always better than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and they might have seen things about this which
had not occurred to him. He felt his eyelids become
heavy and tired and he closed his eyes for
a second. Only a second. He had to keep watch, he
told himself. But even though he fought against
it, he did fall sound asleep as he waited. He
dreamed a hodge podge in which Mr. Grey, Captain
Bob, Ken and Jack were all setting fire to a
house, laughing gleefully. When he awoke he felt
ashamed of himself for not keeping the watch.</p>

<p>He took up his position again and resumed his
watching. How could he fall asleep like that, he
asked himself. And he flushed with embarrassment
to have committed such an act. For all he
knew, somebody may have been here and was
gone again. He looked at his watch. Nine o’clock.
He had been sleeping for almost an hour. He held
his breath and listened. Nothing. For about five
minutes he watched the house and the street. Except
for an occasional bypasser, nothing happened.
He crept out of his hiding and looked all
around the house. Nothing seemed to have happened,
nobody seemed to have been there. Calling
himself a fool, he decided to give up his watch and
to go off.</p>

<p>He walked along and meditated upon his foolish
hunch. Is it a foolish one, though, he asked
himself. If nothing happened tonight, does that
mean that there is no basis for my suspicion? Is
it not possible that something may happen tomorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
night, or the night after? He stopped in his
tracks and thought, suppose something should
happen there now, just after I left? For a second
he felt that he should turn around and take up his
vigil again. He took several steps ahead but then
turned around and walked back.</p>

<p>He came to the house. From across the street,
he let his eyes roam about the place to see if anything
might have happened. Nothing stirred. All
seemed to be still and quiet. He went around the
block, skipped across a fence and came up from
the back of the house. Moving along noiselessly,
he crept along the yard. He had made up his
mind to go once again all around the house and
investigate. Suddenly he caught his breath and
flattened himself on the ground, midst the wild
tall grasses. He saw a shadow coming around the
corner of the house. The man, for such it was
wore dark clothes and a slouch hat pulled down
over the forehead. Like a shadow, the man moved
along the wall. Every few seconds he stopped and
looked and listened. There was something familiar
about that man, Paul thought. He held his
breath and watched, his eyes glued to the moving
figure. The next instant he smiled to himself.</p>

<p>The man came to the front of the house, quickly
ran across and disappeared behind the wall. Paul
got off the ground and sprinted forward. Ducking
around the corner of the house, he saw the
back of the man, who seemed to be hesitating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
undecided as to his next course of action. Paul
moved forward on tiptoes. Coming up from behind,
he touched the man, who jumped as though
touched by an electric spark, “It’s only I, Captain
Bob.”</p>

<p>He smiled. The old man stared into his face
and for several seconds was speechless. “You&mdash;you
certainly gave me a scare, boy,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” apologized Paul, “but I thought
it was so funny to find you groping around here
that&mdash;”</p>

<p>Captain Bob grabbed him by the arm and
pulled him around to the back of the house. Shaking
a finger under the boy’s nose, he muttered,
“You! You young upstart! Scaring me like that
and thinking it’s funny.” His severity melted and
he smiled. “I should imagine it would be funny,”
he said, “but what brings you here, my boy?”</p>

<p>Paul smiled. He had not yet gotten over the
humor of the situation. “I imagine that we both
came here on the same hunch,” he informed the
captain.</p>

<p>“How do you know that my hunch is the same
as yours? Tell me that.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you tell me your hunch and I’ll tell
you mine, Captain Bob,” he said. “And I’ll wager
they are both the same.”</p>

<p>“I asked you first,” replied the old man. “If it
is the same, I won’t hesitate to say so.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Paul, “I happened to be looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
through the newspaper files of the last two months
and I noticed that three out of the last four fires
occurred at houses belonging to the Jones and
Jones realty company. The papers also mentioned
several addresses of other houses of theirs, and I
picked this one to look things over.”</p>

<p>“But why should there be anything suspicious
about that?” asked the shrewd old man.</p>

<p>“I thought that possibly somebody had a
grudge against the realty company or against one
of the Joneses. So I thought I might as well do
a little investigation.”</p>

<p>Captain Bob wobbled his head. “You young
pups!” he muttered. “There is no getting away
from you. Did I hear you say that you want to be
a doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am going away to college in September.
Jack and I, both of us are going to study to be
doctors.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about your friend Jack,
but I think you ought to study to be a detective.”</p>

<p>“Then I guessed?” cried Paul.</p>

<p>“You certainly did,” was the answer. “And let’s
walk away before someone sees us. You go first
and wait for me at the end of the street.”</p>

<p>Paul obeyed. He sprinted across the yard and
over the fence and walked away. Two minutes
later, Captain Bob joined him and he related to
the old man his experience of that night and how
he had already walked off and then returned. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
thought for a while that the hunch was a very
poor one,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the captain. “On the contrary,
it was a most logical one. Have you done any
more investigations along this line?”</p>

<p>Paul became wary. He realized that again Captain
Bob was trying to elicit information from
him. He shook his head. “Not much,” was his
answer.</p>

<p>“Well, just keep it up. Perhaps if we continue
we may yet catch the culprit.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” remarked Paul.</p>

<p>Soon after they separated, Captain Bob saying
that he was going home and Paul seriously intended
to do the same. In front of his own home,
he paused and leaned against the gate. Ken
crossed the street and came up to him. “Say,
where have you been all evening?” inquired the
latter.</p>

<p>“Oh, just following up a hunch of mine.”</p>

<p>“What sort of hunch?”</p>

<p>“Tell you about it later. Did you see Jack?”</p>

<p>“No and he isn’t home either because I went
over to call him.”</p>

<p>Paul leaned against the fence and mused. The
wind pushed a piece of paper against his leg.
Bending down to pull it away, he suddenly remembered
something. “Come on,” he said to his
friend.</p>

<p>“Where to?” asked Ken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“To that house which Jack showed us this
morning.”</p>

<p>“What for? It is kind of late, too. Almost ten
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“We will be back shortly. Come on.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">A Bump on the Head</span></p>

<p>That same night Jack was impatient to be
through with supper, and immediately after, he
left his house and hiked down to Jones Street.
He didn’t know exactly what to expect, nor was he
sure that anything at all was going to happen. He
thought that it would be best to stick around and
if Mr. Grey came out of his hiding, to follow him.
It was now four days after the fire on Water
Street and something was bound to happen in the
immediate future. But what, or how, or when,
was still a mystery to him.</p>

<p>Jack took along with him a brown sweater. He
thought that if there was any need for it, he
would put it on, and thus be able to change his
appearance, if only slightly. He had the sweater
wrapped up in a package under his arm. That too
would make a slight difference in his appearance&mdash;first
carrying a package and later being without
one.</p>

<p>He took the same position as the day before
and he did not have to wait long for darkness to
come. It was already dusk when he came to Jones
Street. Just as soon as it was dark enough, he
changed his place by coming forward and hiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
behind the chassis of a wrecked car. That secured
for him a better view of the street as well as the
corner.</p>

<p>Watchful waiting&mdash;that was his task. But how
long? Wasn’t Mr. Grey ever coming out? Was he
to be disappointed tonight? He glanced at his
watch; it was five minutes after nine. He saw the
stars come out one by one in the sky and the moon
come up on the horizon. In the street and around
the corner there seemed to be very little activity.
People passed up and down but he was not interested
in them. Soon he saw the grocery man
emerge and lock up his store.</p>

<p>Jack waited and watched, counting each minute.
Time hung heavy on his hands. He began to wish,
as he had the day before that he had never
bothered with it at all, but the next instant he
thought differently. He was in it and he meant to
stick it through; he would not give it up just because
he was impatient. It was quite possible, he
thought to himself that Mr. Grey would not attempt
one of his usual jaunts through the town.
After all, one could not expect things to happen
every night. It was quite possible that Mr. Grey
had become suspicious, that he had actually become
aware that he was being followed. Anything
was possible, he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed, fifteen minutes, twenty
minutes&mdash;and still nothing happened. Gradually,
Jack became convinced that Mr. Grey was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
coming out tonight. Suddenly it occurred to him
that perhaps he had come too late. He remembered
that the day before Mr. Grey had ventured
forth at about six-thirty. And tonight he had not
arrived there until about seven-thirty. He nodded
to himself and thought that no doubt he had come
too late. But what to do now and where to look
first? He certainly could not just walk around
town and look for his man; that would probably
be futile. He debated with himself whether to go
to Water Street, to the site of the last fire or to
go to the house where he had followed Mr. Grey
the night before. He decided on the latter course
and off he went.</p>

<p>Peace and darkness shrouded the house. Jack
walked up and down several times on the wrong
side of the street. Then, growing bold he dashed
across the street and into the yard. Not thinking
it wise to approach the house, he crept noiselessly
along the fence and all around the yard. There
seemed to be not a soul around; except for the
wind, nothing else seemed to stir. He approached
the wall of the house and tried to peek into a window.
But it was dark and, naturally, he saw
nothing.</p>

<p>Cautiously, Jack approached the front of the
house. Suddenly he stopped and held his breath.
He heard a slight rumbling noise. He listened
closely. Again the same noise. “Mice or rats,” he
told himself. He moved forward again then, flattening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
himself out against the wall, he waited. A
woman passed down the street. He took out his
searchlight which he was now glad he had
brought, and moved forward again to the front
of the house. Putting his hand on the knob, he
turned it and the door opened slightly. Wondering
how it was that the hinges, probably rusty,
did not squeak, he pushed the door wider open.</p>

<p>He flashed his light on and stepped quickly into
the hall and closed the door behind him. He threw
a beam of light on the papers which Paul had
pointed out to him; they were still there, in the
same spot and untouched. Again he thought he
heard a slight rumbling noise. Backing up close
against the wall, he listened. Yes, there it was
again. Rats or mice, he thought to himself. For
a fraction of a second he hesitated. What was he
doing in here, he asked himself. Did he expect to
find Mr. Grey in the house? If so, what would he
do if he did? Beside, Paul, Ken and he had been
in the house only that morning.</p>

<p>Brushing aside all the doubts in his mind, he
tiptoed along the hall. He passed one door, the
second door. He retraced his steps and threw a
beam of light upon the stairway. Suddenly he felt
a sharp blow on the back of his head. His knees
gave way and before he crashed to the floor, he
sensed a figure fleeing past him and out through
the door. As he fell to the floor he saw a million
colored stars converging upon his eyes. Innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
distorted thoughts flashed through his mind.
Then darkness and he knew no more.</p>

<p>Jack opened his eyes and through a haze saw
two figures hovering over him. He reached to the
back of his head and writhed with pain. Somebody
was bending over him and talking but he could not
understand what he was saying; it sounded like
buzzing in his ears. He closed his eyes and relaxed.
Very suddenly he sat up and looked around.
He rubbed his eyes, then the back of his head; he
felt a large bump there and touching it made him
shiver with pain. “How are you, old boy?” somebody
was asking him.</p>

<p>The person bending over him, murmured
softly, “How do you feel, Jack old boy?”</p>

<p>The mist before his eyes cleared and in the
darkness he made out Paul on his knees in front
of him and a short distance away, Ken. He turned
his head and he noticed that he was in the open.
“W-w-where am I?” he asked, his face distorted
with pain as he touched the bump on the back of
his head.</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” Paul assured him. “Just tell
me how you feel. Any broken bones?” he asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>Jack felt himself all over, and answered, “No,
I guess not.” Looking into his friend’s smiling
face, he also grinned, “Just where am I and what
happened to me?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“What happened to you, I don’t know; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
will have to tell us that. But I can tell you where
we are. We are in the yard of&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” interrupted Jack. He now remembered
the house, where he had been socked
on the head. Rising to his feet, he felt a little
wobbly. Paul supported him. “Let’s go away from
here,” he said dejectedly.</p>

<p>Paul laughed. “Nobody will attack us,” he
said.</p>

<p>They walked off. Jack was flanked on either
side by Paul and Ken. After a short silence, Jack
asked, “How did you come to be there? And tell
me what happened, will you?”</p>

<p>“You’d better tell us what happened,” asserted
Ken. “We found you there stretched out horizontally.
Some bump you have, too.”</p>

<p>Jack touched the wound and groaned with pain.
“It’s nothing much,” said Paul. “You’ll live a
long time yet.”</p>

<p>Paul and Ken laughed. But Jack couldn’t see
what was so funny. Ken said, “Come on, tell us
what happened.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” protested Jack, “I wish I knew
myself. The last thing I can remember is that I
got an awful wallop on the back of the head and
sock! I was out.”</p>

<p>“Who was that person we saw running away
from the house?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>Jack stopped in his tracks. “Running away!” he
exclaimed. “Who? What? When?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ken and I,” Paul explained, “were coming up
the street. We were about ten feet from the house,
when we saw somebody dash out of the yard and
down toward the other end of the street. We
thought there might be something wrong so we
investigated.”</p>

<p>“And we found you,” added Ken.</p>

<p>“He must have been the fellow who socked you
on the head,” concluded Paul.</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t one of you go after him?”
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Somebody had to take care of you, didn’t
they?” questioned Paul.</p>

<p>“By then it was too late,” added Ken.</p>

<p>Jack began to walk back toward the house.
“Come on,” he said, “we’re going back and see
what happened.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Paul. “We looked and
didn’t see a thing.”</p>

<p>Jack felt his pockets. “Besides,” he added, “my
flashlight must be somewhere there in the hall.”</p>

<p>“No. Here it is,” said Ken, taking it out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>But Jack insisted on going back to the house
and they did. Ken was left outside on guard while
the other two entered the house. They found the
first door in the hall open. The dust on the floor
was stirred by many footprints but there was
nothing else visible in the room. The two returned
to the hall and searched but they found nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
“I wonder who it was that socked me like that?”
muttered Jack.</p>

<p>“It’s no use wondering because you can only
guess,” asserted Paul. “My own opinion is that
some stray individual happened to be in here when
you entered and just as your back was turned, he
hit you on the head and escaped. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“But why? Why?” demanded Jack. “And what
was he doing here?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? And since there is nothing
else we can do here, let’s go.”</p>

<p>Joining Ken, they walked off and went home.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Discovery</span></p>

<p>Ken was saying, “It is rather strange that somebody
should have been in that house when it is
supposed to be empty and deserted.”</p>

<p>“But why?” demanded Paul. “Being empty and
unoccupied, anybody might walk in and look
around.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” commented Jack, “but why should
he sock me, that’s something I can’t understand.”
He put his hand behind his head and winced with
pain. “Suppose,” he continued, “some person does
stray into the house and while he is there I enter.
Does that mean that he has to bang me on the
head and run away? It is not logical. There must
be something to it.”</p>

<p>“You may be right,” conceded Paul, “but somehow
it doesn’t strike me so. By the way, did I tell
you fellows how I ran into Captain Bob last
night and almost scared him to death?”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Ken. “Tell us.”</p>

<p>Paul narrated his last night’s adventure. The
boys laughed heartily at the thought of Captain
Bob being scared out of his wits. He also told
them that the captain had also had the same
hunch as he. Then he asked, “What do you fellows
think of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack merely shrugged his shoulders, manifesting
his lack of opinion. Ken, however, said, “It
sounds quite logical to me.”</p>

<p>“Logic does not always prove anything,” remarked
Paul.</p>

<p>Jack jumped out of his seat and snapped his
fingers. “I have an idea,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Tell us,” said Ken.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“It is something I couldn’t exactly explain; it’s
just something I feel&mdash;a hunch. Come on, we’re
going back to that empty house.”</p>

<p>“But what for?” demanded Paul. “We have
been there several times and we have found no
clues or anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going back and look again.”</p>

<p>Jack disappeared into the house and a minute
later came out carrying his flashlight and as baseball
bat. “What is the bat for?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Just in case of anything,” was the answer.
“I’m not taking chances any more.”</p>

<p>The boys rocked with laughter, Jack joining
in. “You think you’re going to hit somebody with
that thing?” questioned Ken, still laughing.</p>

<p>“I suppose the fellow who hit you is waiting
there for you to even things up,” commented Paul.</p>

<p>“You fellows can laugh all you want,” said
Jack, “but I’m taking it along just the same. Come
on.”</p>

<p>They were on their way. Jack said, “Paul, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and I are going into the house, while you, Ken,
are going to hide outside and give us the usual
signal in case you see somebody suspicious coming
up the street or about to enter the house.”</p>

<p>“And what are we going to do?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“You and I are going into that first room and
investigate. If there is anything to be found, somehow
I feel convinced that it will be found in that
room. I have only one reason for it. When I was
hit on the head I had my back to that door. Therefore
the person who hit me came out of that
room.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable,” remarked Paul.
“But I, on the contrary, have no illusions about
finding any clues there. It seems to me that we
went over every inch of ground in that room.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong, Paul,” contradicted Jack.
“All we did was merely look around. We did not
make a real search of the room.”</p>

<p>The boys came to the house. All three of them
made sure of a good location for Ken to hide
and keep watch. When that was done, Paul and
Jack entered the house and closed the door behind
them. “Now,” whispered Jack, “Let’s open the
door of this first room and examine it.” Jack did
so and swung the door back and forth on its
hinges. “Notice something?” he asked his chum.</p>

<p>“I most certainly do, Jack. This is very
suspicious.”</p>

<p>“What is it you notice?” asked Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, the movement of the door swinging on
its hinges; it’s noiseless. Isn’t that what you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The hinges must be well oiled and that is
why I did not hear when the door was opened and
I was hit on the head. Under normal circumstances,
the hinges should be rusty and there
should be plenty of squeaking every time the door
is swung open.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Jack. But I still don’t see what
your hunch is.”</p>

<p>“Let’s just wait and see. I don’t know exactly
what it is myself yet. I can only make a wild guess.
Let’s go into the room.”</p>

<p>They entered and closed the door behind them.
They had no use for their flashlights because the
room had a window in each corner wall, and it
was now early morning, about ten o’clock. “Notice
another thing,” remarked Jack. “The windows&mdash;they
are all in perfect shape.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, but that is nothing extraordinary.
It is possible that the last tenant had moved
out only recently.”</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t matter so much. Shall we
first thoroughly go over the walls or the floor?”</p>

<p>Paul looked about for several seconds before
he answered. “I think we had better do the floor
first.” They looked down. “You know,” continued
Paul, “I am somehow beginning to get a hunch
like you have. I can’t exactly explain it, but&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack interrupted, crying enthusiastically, “Do
you really mean that? Because then&mdash;”</p>

<p>Paul held up a finger to his lips and cautioned,
“Sh! Not so loud. Walls have ears, you know,
and all that.” Both of them crouched down. “Do
you notice something odd about the dust on the
floor?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jack. “I noticed it the first time
we were here but I forgot to mention it. There
seems to be very little dust on this floor compared
to the other rooms.”</p>

<p>“That is right. Now you begin at the other
end of the room and I will begin at this end of the
room. Examine every single plank of wood and
see if it lifts out of the floor.”</p>

<p>“That was my intention exactly,” whispered
Jack. “You are getting on to my hunch perfectly.”</p>

<p>Paul by now had become excited with the new
turn of events and he was eager to be doing something.
“Less talk and more work,” he snapped at
his friend briskly.</p>

<p>Jack smiled and moved away to his end of the
floor. The boys partitioned the floor in half and
set to work with zest. They ran their hands over
the floor and tested each plank. Despite their
eagerness and rapid movements, it took them a
long time. The two of them must have been working
close to an hour, and Paul was occupied now
in front of the window when he hissed across the
room, “Jack, I have it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul flushed with excitement. Jack raced across
the room and joined his friend. Paul had discovered
a removable piece of wood about six inches
long by about three inches wide. He held it up
in his hand. “Now!” he whispered. He plunged
his hand into the opening and pulled. But too
much effort was not necessary, the trap door
opened easily. Jack was ready to rush right down,
but Paul, ever prudent and careful, grabbed him
by the arm and restrained him. “Wait a moment,”
he whispered. “Let’s make sure of things.”</p>

<p>Paul went to the window and peeked out. He
located Ken and saw the boy on guard, his eyes
roaming everywhere and on the alert. Jack had in
the meanwhile gone out into the hall. Paul now
joined him and together they looked through the
house to make sure whether anyone was in there
or was watching them. Reassured at last, they
returned to the room and again pulled up the
trap door. There were stairs leading down, but
it was dark below and Jack flashed on his light.
From every appearance it looked like an ordinary
cellar. Paul whispered, “All right, let’s go down.
I’ll go first.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded and his chum began to descend the
stairs. He followed, gripping his bat in his hand.
Becoming conscious of the weapon, he smiled to
himself remembering how his friends joked at his
taking it along. Now, in case of anything, it would
be very useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul, who carried the flashlight, reached the
bottom of the stairs and waited for his chum. Jack
joined him. Together they followed the beam of
light around the room. At one side was a printing
press and quite a bit of printing paraphernalia; in
the center of the room was a table and several
chairs; against the walls were several boxes, a
jacket and a cap hung on a nail and from the ceiling
there extended an electric bulb. Jack whispered,
“What do you make of it all?”</p>

<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders. Again he threw
a beam of light all around the room. Satisfied with
what he saw, he turned and motioned to his friend
that they leave. Jack shook his head. “No,” he
whispered, “let’s see exactly what they have
here.”</p>

<p>“Not now,” was the whispered reply. “Some
other time.”</p>

<p>He began to mount the stairs and Jack followed.
They closed the trap after them and replaced
the piece of wood. Paul went over to the
window and peeked out. And it was a lucky thing
that he did. Locating Ken on the spot they had
left him, he noticed the guard put his fingers to his
lips and whistle. But they could not hear the whistle
because both the door to the house and the
door to the room were closed. Grabbing Jack by
the arm, he cried, “Hurry!” and dragged him
out of the room. In the hall they just managed to
duck under the stairs as the door opened and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the sound of the footsteps the boys guessed that
two men had entered. They heard a gruff voice
mutter, “All right, we’ll do it.”</p>

<p>The next instant they heard the second door
open and close. Venturing out from their hiding
place, they listened carefully to the opening of
the trap door, one man descending, then the
second man descending and then, plop, the trap
door closing again. The boys looked at each other.
Paul smiled while Jack wiped the perspiration off
his forehead with a muffled sigh of relief. Paul
opened the door noiselessly and they stepped out
into the open. At a sign from Paul, Ken was in an
instant over the fence and away. A moment later
Jack and Paul were out of the yard and running
down the street.</p>

<p>They joined Ken at the end of the street. The
two boys did not dare to speak until they were
some distance away from the empty house.
Finally, Jack, who couldn’t restrain himself any
more, heaved a very audible sigh of relief and
exclaimed, “Boy! Was that a close shave! I’m so
nervous, my hands are shaking.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Ken who could see
that something important had transpired.</p>

<p>“Let’s not talk now,” said Paul. “Wait until
we get someplace where we can’t be overheard.”
He looked from one of his friends to the other.
“Don’t look so curious and excited,” he added.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
“Let’s discuss some ordinary topic. Did you fix
your dad’s car, Jack?”</p>

<p>Jack looked at his chum and burst out laughing.
Paul looked as calm and unconcerned as
though nothing had happened. “I’m glad to see
you fellows enjoying your fun,” remarked Ken.
“But I wish you would tell me the joke so I could
also enjoy it and laugh.”</p>

<p>That set both Jack and Paul laughing. “Pardon
us, Ken,” said Paul. “But there really is nothing
to laugh about. That’s the joke. But we will tell
you all about it right away.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">A New Turn of Events</span></p>

<p>Jack stopped dead in his tracks. His two
friends also stopped and faced him. “What is it?”
asked Paul.</p>

<p>“I was just wondering,” answered Jack,
“whether we shouldn’t go back there, watch until
those two leave and then go down there again.”</p>

<p>“Go down where?” asked Ken; they had not
yet told him of the cellar they had discovered.</p>

<p>Paul shook his head. “No,” he said. “We have
had enough for one day. And then, I want some
time to think this thing over and try to piece
everything together. Let’s go to Ken’s garage
where we can have some privacy.”</p>

<p>“You really think we shouldn’t go back?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m convinced.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me,” said Ken as the three of
them continued walking. “I’m only an ornament
among the three of us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so impatient,” said Paul. “Wait.
We’ll tell you everything.”</p>

<p>They came to Ken’s garage and sat down on
boxes. Paul related what had happened. Several
times Ken gasped in astonishment. When the story
was finally ended, Paul commented, “But what
puzzles me is how all the incidents fit together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
The fires, Mr. Grey, Jack getting bumped on the
head, Captain Bob, where do all these facts fit in?”</p>

<p>“As far as Captain Bob is concerned, you can
leave him out of it,” commented Jack. “No matter
what it is all about, I’m quite sure he is an
innocent party.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ken. “As chief of the fire department
he naturally would be interested in why there
are an unusually large number of fires.”</p>

<p>“All right, suppose we agree that Captain Bob
is out of it,” said Paul, “what about all the other
facts. How does Mr. Grey fit in, for example?”</p>

<p>“Yes, how does he fit in?” asked Ken. “Isn’t
it possible that what you stumbled on today has
nothing to do with all the other incidents?”</p>

<p>“It may sound all right,” remarked Jack, “but
I don’t think so. For example, by now I am convinced
that the fellow who hit me came out of
that cellar.”</p>

<p>“But why should he run away?” questioned
Paul. “Why couldn’t he have made you a prisoner,
as that would be a more natural thing to do?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” argued Jack. “But if he had, he
would have had to take me down in the cellar.
Now suppose he blindfolds me, still I might
hear something they say. I might escape and inform
the police. My opinion is that he hit me and
ran away, hoping that the blow on the head would
scare me so that I would never return.”</p>

<p>His two companions nodded. “Suppose we accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that as the real reason. Where does everything
else fit in? What are they doing with a printing
press down there? They shouldn’t have to
hide that.”</p>

<p>“But the mere fact that they are hiding it is
proof that they are doing something illegal,”
commented Ken.</p>

<p>His two companions repeated the word, “Illegal!
Illegal!”</p>

<p>Jack began to walk up and down, his chin in
his hand and deep in thought. The other two were
also silent and thinking hard. Jack picked up an
old newspaper from the floor. Suddenly he dropped
the paper, jumped high into the air and cried
frantically, “I have it! I have it!”</p>

<p>His two friends leaped out of their seats, and
ran up to him. “Well!” demanded Paul, for once
impatient and curious. “What is the answer?”</p>

<p>“The answer is,” whispered Jack and then
paused, “Counterfeiters!” he whispered.</p>

<p>Ken jumped into the air enthusiastically.
“That’s right!” he cried. “That’s right!”</p>

<p>Paul smiled with satisfaction. Putting an arm
around Jack, he said, “It sounds very reasonable.
Counterfeiters have to use a printing press. And
counterfeiters do something illegal and therefore
have to hide.” He nodded his head. “Sounds very
logical.”</p>

<p>They returned to their seats. “But,” continued
Paul, “even if we grant the fact that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
counterfeiters, how do all the other incidents fit
in? The fires and Mr. Grey for example?”</p>

<p>“Must they fit in?” inquired Ken.</p>

<p>“They don’t have to,” was Paul’s reply, “but
I have a notion that they do.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded and agreed with his chum. “I feel
the same way about it,” he said. “It is very possible
that what we have discovered today has absolutely
nothing to do with the fires or Mr. Grey.
But somehow I have a feeling that there is some
connection. But I can’t say what.”</p>

<p>“But if there is some sort of a connection between
all these facts, how do you think they fit
in?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>Jack shook his head. Ken said, “Suppose we begin
from the very beginning. I mean from the time
you came upon the house, Jack. Now, was it not
Mr. Grey who led you to the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And then he sneaked around in the back
and scared me half to death.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now if he had anything to do with
the counterfeiters do you think he would have led
you to that very house he wants you to keep away
from? If he were a member of that gang of counterfeiters
and he knew you were following him,
don’t you think he would lead you to some other
part of town?”</p>

<p>Paul said, “That may sound logical, but the
opposite may also sound logical. For example, if
we concede that the fellow who hit Jack on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
head and then ran away did it to frighten him so
that he would keep away from there, why can’t we
say the same thing about Mr. Grey? Is it not possible
that Mr. Grey knew he was being followed
and purposely led Jack to that very house, then
sneaked up behind him to frighten him so that he
would never return? Isn’t that very plausible?”</p>

<p>“Say,” cried Jack, “if what you say is true, that
fellow certainly made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“And how!” echoed Ken.</p>

<p>“Now if we know all that,” continued Paul,
“that makes Mr. Grey a member of the gang of
counterfeiters.”</p>

<p>“But what about the fires? And leading Betty
away. And those white cards, what about them?
And the robbery at Professor Link’s?”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other very glumly.
“The whole thing is like a crazy jigsaw puzzle,”
muttered Paul.</p>

<p>“Telling me!” mumbled Ken. “It has already
given me a headache. The thing worries me so,
I can’t sleep nights.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed at the manner in which Ken
said it. “You have to sleep,” remarked Jack.
“Otherwise how are we going to solve this jigsaw
puzzle of a mystery?”</p>

<p>The boys sat around and brooded. Three minds
with one thought&mdash;how to solve the mystery; how
all the details fitted into the general picture. They
were so silent and lost in thought that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
not at all aware of Ken’s little sister Betty approaching
and regarding them with surprise. She
stood rooted in one spot and stared at her brother
and his two friends. Finally she couldn’t bear it
any longer. She opened her mouth wide and cried
suddenly, “Boo!” The boys jumped as though
they were shot. Reassured again, they smiled
heaving sighs of relief. “Mother says you should
come to dinner,” she said.</p>

<p>“Dinner!” exclaimed Ken. “Is it time for dinner
already?”</p>

<p>All three simultaneously looked at their watches.
“My, how time flies,” mumbled Jack. “Twelve-thirty
already.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong came to the porch and called,
“Betty!”</p>

<p>“I’m right here, Mother,” cried the child. And
she ran to the porch.</p>

<p>“Did you find Ken?”</p>

<p>“He is at the garage. And Jack and Paul too.”</p>

<p>“Tell them all to come in; lunch is ready.”</p>

<p>The boys entered the house. Paul and Jack telephoned
home that they were having lunch with
Ken. At the table, in the midst of the meal, Jack
almost choked as he thought of something. “Hurry
up, fellows,” he whispered. “I’ve just thought
of something important.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you at least eat without thinking?”
mocked Ken.</p>

<p>“Yes, take it easy,” was Paul’s advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Choke easy, you mean,” corrected Ken.</p>

<p>“Stop all that talk,” spoke up Jack, “and hurry
up and finish. I want to get out and talk this thing
over.”</p>

<p>As soon as they were through with their meal,
the boys retreated to the garage again. “Now
what is it?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“It is something that I thought of just as soon
as we got into the cellar,” replied Jack, “but it
slipped my mind and I forgot to mention it.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Ken. “Don’t keep us
in suspense.”</p>

<p>“It’s this. When we descended the stairs into
the cellar, Paul, it occurred to me that if the police
cornered the gang of counterfeiters in that cellar,
how would they manage to escape?”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t,” was Ken’s opinion.</p>

<p>“Suppose you were one of the gang, wouldn’t
you think of such a possibility and make sure of
an exit, of a means of escape?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then that means, that probably there is another
entrance or exit into that cellar.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Paul. “I’m glad you
thought of it. It is something we should have
thought of at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh I wish you didn’t,” said Ken, pretending
that he was in tears, “because that only adds another
item in the puzzle to solve.”</p>

<p>“Which isn’t going to be very easy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, it certainly won’t.”</p>

<p>“Let’s come down to earth now,” remarked Jack,
“and think in terms of action. What are we going
to do now? What should be our plan of action
from now on? Can you think of anything, Paul?”</p>

<p>For a short while, there was silence. At last
Paul ventured to suggest, “We might, for example,
give up following Mr. Grey; at least temporarily.
Then we have to watch that house and get
to know the men entering and leaving and determine
as well as we can who the members of the
gang are.”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of something,” remarked
Ken. “Do you remember, Paul, how hostile the
grocery man was and how he squirmed out of
giving you any information about Mr. Grey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it just occurred to me, that the man must
know something if he is so anxious to conceal it.”</p>

<p>“Hmm!” muttered Jack.</p>

<p>“Another thing,” continued Ken. “Isn’t it true,
Jack, that each time you followed Mr. Grey, it
seemed to you that he emerged from that corner
house, the house in which the store is situated?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. What are you driving at?”</p>

<p>Ken scratched his head. “I feel this way about
it,” he said, “that most likely that corner house is
owned or at least rented by the grocery man. Now
if Mr. Grey comes out of that house, he must
live there.” His two companions leaned forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and listened to him attentively. They suspected
that what he was saying might be very valuable.
He continued, “Therefore, if Mr. Grey lives in
that house, the grocery man must know him;
under ordinary circumstances, he would have no
reason to say that he didn’t know Mr. Grey. It
therefore follows that either he knows that Mr.
Grey is a crook or possibly he himself is somehow
involved in the situation.”</p>

<p>The boys gasped. The reasonableness and logic
of Ken’s statement was beyond question. Yet how
true was it? If it were true, another missing link
was being added to the already complicating puzzle.
“Then why,” asked Jack, “should the woman
have mentioned the name Mr. Grey when you entered
the store and asked for information Ken?”</p>

<p>Paul answered, “That’s simple. If we assume
that what Ken said is true, the grocery man’s wife
knows nothing of her husband’s operations and
very innocently gave away the name.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” agreed Ken.</p>

<p>“That only makes it worse,” muttered Jack.</p>

<p>Again the group became silent. They would hit
upon an idea, discuss it rapidly and then they
would brood for a while. Jack leaped to his feet.
“Let’s do something,” he cried.</p>

<p>Paul rose. “I for one,” he said, “am going home
and I suggest you do the same. That will calm us
down. Then we will meet again after supper and&mdash;do
something.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Following Up Their Clues</span></p>

<p>Jack was restless, excited. The mystery had him
upset. While Paul and Ken each went to their respective
homes, Jack loitered along Main Street.
Not that he hoped to do anything or come upon
any clues; he merely didn’t feel like going home.
He walked down as far as Jones Street and again
investigated the neighborhood. Returning to the
corner, he went into the store and on the pretense
that he was buying a small box of chocolate wafers,
he let his eyes wander about the place. But there
was nothing especial to see; it was the same as any
other ordinary grocery. The woman was in the
store and she appeared to be a mild sort of person.
Considering it unwise to ask any questions
or seek any information from her, he paid for
his wafers and left.</p>

<p>He munched as he walked along. Thinking
hard for some plan of action, he couldn’t come to
any definite decision. Finally he concluded that
Paul was right&mdash;he should go home and let the
matter rest for a while. Quickening his pace, he
walked home and busied himself with tasks about
the house.</p>

<p>After supper, the three boys met at Paul’s
home. They sat down on the porch and waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
for someone to speak first. Paul finally spoke up
and said, “Right now, I think, we have to look
into two angles of the situation. One of us should
go down to Jones Street and watch the grocery
man. The other two should go back to that empty
house and see what happens there.”</p>

<p>“How about you going down to Jones Street?”
asked Jack. “You spoke to the grocery man and
you know what he looks like.”</p>

<p>“That suits me. You and Ken, in the meanwhile,
will watch the empty house.”</p>

<p>“How about that other angle of yours, Paul?
The one about watching out for a fire at some
house owned by the Jones and Jones real estate
company,” commented Ken. “I think it’s a good
hunch that we ought to follow up.”</p>

<p>“I think we can drop it for tonight at any rate
and see what happens,” answered Paul. “Let’s
go.”</p>

<p>They walked off the porch and headed for
Main Street. “So long,” called Paul, and waved.</p>

<p>“Good luck,” returned Jack.</p>

<p>“We’ll be seeing you,” said Ken.</p>

<p>Jack and Ken walked off together. “It’s a little
early yet, don’t you think?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>Jack looked at his watch; it was not quite
seven-thirty. “Yes,” he answered. “But we will go
down there anyhow and see.”</p>

<p>They walked past the house as though they
were ordinary pedestrians. Coming to the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
tracks, they turned around and walked back
through the street on which the back of the house
faced. It was eight o’clock now but it was still
daylight. So they decided to walk around the block
once more and as far as the railroad tracks. As
soon as it became dusk, they returned to the
house and took up different positions. Jack hid
himself directly behind the fence overlooking the
front of the house; Ken, on the other hand, picked
out a hiding place at the rear of the house. The
two were thus able to keep a watch all around the
house and at the same time be within reach of
each other in case of necessity.</p>

<p>The boys watched the sky become gray and the
stars come out; the moon crept out of the horizon
and night descended. Perfectly still, noiseless, inconspicuous,
the two kept guard. Every once in a
while, people passed up and down the street, and
immediately Jack was on the alert, anxious, impatient.
But nothing happened and time dragged
along. Suddenly he heard the sound of a soft whistle
and he turned his head to locate Ken. Again
the same soft whistle. Jack looked all around him,
then, very cautiously, he crept over to his friend.
Ken had his ear to the ground. Jack whispered,
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>Ken motioned for his friend to put his ear to
the ground and Jack did so. He flattened himself
out and glued his ear to the ground. A slight trembling
of the earth came to his ears, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
by a steady, muffled sound. For about five minutes
both boys put their ears to the ground and listened.
Ken, although he guessed what it was,
whispered, “What do you think it is?”</p>

<p>“The printing press.”</p>

<p>Ken nodded. “I thought so too.”</p>

<p>Jack whispered, “When did you first hear that
sound?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It seemed to begin only a short while ago.”</p>

<p>The boys were silent, thinking hard. If the press
had been operating only a short while, then it was
most logical to conclude that whoever was in the
cellar had come there recently, within the last
thirty, forty, fifty minutes. Yet the boys had been
on guard for a full hour and as far as they knew,
no one had entered the house by the front door.
Jack, therefore, became more firmly convinced
that there was another door somewhere; that the
cellar could be reached and left perhaps some distance
away from the house. Jack whispered, “I’m
going back.”</p>

<p>Ken nodded. His friend crept away and again he
was alone. Each one in his own hiding place, they
watched and waited, but nothing happened. Overhead
was the blue sky with the moon and the stars.
All around them was darkness. Their waiting and
watching was in vain&mdash;at least so it seemed.</p>

<p>Another hour passed and still nothing happened.
Ken lay with his ear to the ground and occupied
himself with listening to the hissing sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that came out of the earth. Jack watched and
waited but not a thing stirred. He became restless
and chafed with impatience. Finally he wiggled
over to Ken and also put his ear to the ground.
Still that hissing sound and the trembling of the
earth. Ken whispered, “They must be working
hard down there.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded and kept silent. Together they lay
flat on the ground and listened. Again it was Ken
who whispered, “What do you say, you think we
ought to go? There is nothing doing here.”</p>

<p>“No, let’s wait a short while more. I wonder
what Paul is doing.”</p>

<p>“Same here. I hope at least he has found something
interesting to do. This doing nothing is killing
me.”</p>

<p>Jack felt the same way about it. As a matter of
fact, Jack was of more impatient nature than Ken,
but he felt it upon himself to urge his friend on.
“Take it easy and don’t lose your patience,” he
whispered back. “A thing like this takes time you
know; plenty of time.”</p>

<p>Again they fixed their ears to the ground. They
remained like that for a short time. Suddenly they
pushed their ears deeper into the ground. In the
darkness, they looked at each other. “Do you hear
what I hear?” whispered Ken.</p>

<p>“Yes, nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. They must have stopped the
printing press.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. Now what?”</p>

<p>Silence. The boys knitted their brows. If they
had stopped their press, Jack asked himself,
would they be coming out of the cellar now? And
if they were, which door would they use? Possibly
they would come out by the front door because
they might not care to use the same door for an
exit as well as an entrance. But if they did use the
rear door how would the boys find it? Jack looked
around. It might be in either of three directions,
he reasoned to himself&mdash;on either sides of the
house or to the rear; to the front was the sidewalk
and street, which would be a most improbable
means for a tunnel or other form of approach
and exit. “Stay here,” he whispered to Ken. “I’m
going back to my place. We will stay here another
half hour, and if nothing happens, I have
other plans.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later.”</p>

<p>Jack crept back to his hiding place. With nothing
else to do but to wait and watch he again became
conscious of the darkness and of time dragging.
There was utter stillness and he could hear
himself breathe; the tick of his watch in his pocket
sounded extraordinarily loud. He waited. A few
pedestrians passed by. He waited some more. He
counted every minute. When the time was up a low
muffled whistle issued from his lips. He turned his
head and saw Ken creep out of his place. Together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
they sneaked out of the yard and walked
off. Ken asked, “Well, what are your other
plans?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” said Jack, “that they must
have another way of getting in and out&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, you mentioned that once before.”</p>

<p>“Well, what I was really trying to determine is
where that other entrance might be. Now, logically,
it can be at any one of three places. There
might be a tunnel leading away from the cellar
of the house on either side or at the rear. What
we have to do, therefore, is to examine those three
possibilities.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t do much tonight,” remarked
Ken. “For one thing it’s dark and there isn’t much
we can see. And secondly, it’s late already.”</p>

<p>“That’s very true, but I certainly would like to
get an idea of how the land lays.”</p>

<p>“We can leave that for tomorrow. Now I think
we ought to go over and see if Paul is waiting for
us.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I almost forgot about him. I
wonder if he came across anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only hope that he didn’t have to spend
such a dull time as we did,” was Ken’s comment.</p>

<p>“You have to take things as they come,” answered
Jack. “Sometimes there is plenty to do and
at other times there is nothing to do.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Paul Gets Into Trouble</span></p>

<p>Ken and Jack came to Paul’s house but they saw
their friend nowhere around. “You think he is in
the house?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“No. He would be waiting for us on the porch.”</p>

<p>“What will we do, then? Where will we wait
for him?”</p>

<p>“Let’s wait for him in front of your gate, Ken.
He ought to be coming any minute, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The boys leaned against the fence, talking in
low tones to while the time away. They were impressed
before with how hard it is to be patient,
but now it was doubly hard. For it seemed that
Paul was not coming. They waited thirty minutes,
an hour, an hour and thirty minutes and still no
Paul. Jack was actually becoming worried that
something had happened to his chum. Ken suggested
several times, “Perhaps he is home. Do you
think we ought to try to find out? Though it’s a
little too late to ring the bell.”</p>

<p>But Jack knew better; he knew his chum. If
Paul had returned before they did, he would have
waited for them on the porch; that was a certainty.
He would not have gone to bed until he
had seen and spoken to his friends and made sure
that they were all right. Finally Jack could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
bear it any longer and he muttered, “I’m going to
look for him.”</p>

<p>“I’m going with you,” said Ken with determination.
“Where will we look first?”</p>

<p>“There are only two places where we can look&mdash;at
Jones Street and then that empty house.”</p>

<p>“Where will we go first?”</p>

<p>“What do you think?”</p>

<p>They went down to Main Street, then they were
undecided as to which direction to take. Jack said,
“Let’s toss a coin.” He drew a nickel out of his
pocket. “Heads we go to Jones Street; tails we go
to that empty house.”</p>

<p>He tossed the coin into the air, caught it with
his right hand and slapped it down on his left
wrist. Ken put his head close to see. Jack removed
his hand&mdash;it was tails up. “The empty house,” he
whispered.</p>

<p>When Paul started out early in the evening, he
leisurely strolled along Main Street until he came
to his destination. There, he examined the house
on the corner from every possible view. It was a
two story frame house with the grocery occupying
most of the ground floor; the rest of the floor,
Paul figured, were either closets or some form of
storage places. He was pretty sure there were no
living quarters on the ground floor. The people
who occupied the house lived above the store. By
counting the windows&mdash;there were seven&mdash;he reasoned
that there must be either three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
rooms. The grocery man and his wife most likely
occupied one room, Mr. Grey another, and the
children, if there were any, the other one or two
rooms.</p>

<p>By now it had become dusk and Paul thought
that it was time to take up some hiding position
and watch. The next moment he changed his
mind. Instead of hiding anywhere, he nonchalantly
took up a position across the street and
pretended that he was waiting for someone. He
didn’t have to wait long. Pretty soon he saw Mr.
Grey emerge from around the corner and walk
up Main Street. He wondered where the man
was going and what he might be up to. For several
seconds he debated with himself whether to
follow him or to wait, as he had previously decided,
for the grocery man. He chose to wait.
About fifteen minutes later he saw his man come
out from the rear of the house. “Very clever,” he
thought to himself.</p>

<p>The grocery man came to the corner and
stopped, looked around and then walked off down
Jones Street. Paul wanted to follow but on second
consideration he realized that the street was deserted
and he would instantly be noticed. He had
a hunch, however, that the man’s walking down
Jones Street was done on purpose to detect anyone
following. Paul ran to the next parallel street
and raced to come to the corner first. He hid in a
doorway and saw his man round the corner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
continue walking on the street parallel to Main
Street. This part of the town was rather empty
and deserted. He therefore decided to let his man
walk at least two hundred and fifty yards ahead
of him.</p>

<p>Soon the street became busier, with many people
strolling up and down. Paul gradually narrowed
the distance between himself and his man.
They came to about the centre of the town. Suddenly
he caught his breath and his heart began to
beat rapidly. He saw Mr. Grey walking the other
way, and as the two men passed each other, there
was a slight movement of the head on the part of
both of them. So they did know each other! So
there was some connection between the two! Paul
thrilled with the excitement of it.</p>

<p>At the next corner, the grocery man turned in
and headed for Main Street, where he turned
right and walked straight ahead for several
blocks. At about the middle of the street he joined
a group of three men who were standing to one
side and talking quietly among themselves. Paul
crossed to the other side of the street. Pretending
that he was looking at a window display, he was
actually studying the group of four men. As far
as he could tell, they were not native townspeople;
everything about them looked as though they
came from somewhere else; possibly from a large
city. Two of them were very ordinary looking&mdash;of
average size and wearing the usual summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
clothes. The third person was a tall, fat individual,
with a big head and a double chin. One thing
was common for all three; they all were rather
hard looking. Such was the trio that the grocery
man had joined.</p>

<p>It was evident that they had a lot to say to
each other, for they talked for some time, while
people passed up and down and paid no attention
to them. Paul decided on a bold step. Walking
down a bit, he crossed over and, falling in behind
a group of strollers, he passed close to the group
of conspirators. But they talked in such low tones
that he could not overhear a word they said.</p>

<p>Not seeing any other opportunity of overhearing
their conversation, Paul crossed over again,
pretended that he was looking at a window display
and walked down to the corner and back again.
But every second he kept an eye on that group.
Finally after about half an hour, the group broke
up into twos. The big, fat fellow with one of his
companions walked south, while the grocery man
and the third of the trio walked north on Main
Street. Paul decided to follow the grocery man
and his companion.</p>

<p>They walked straight ahead for several blocks,
then, very nonchalantly rounded the corner and
disappeared. Paul felt the thrill of excitement
grow on him; something hot and exciting bubbled
inside of him. They had turned into the street on
which the empty house was situated. He thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of Ken and Jack and their being on guard. But
just then Jack’s well founded hunch occurred to
him; perhaps there was a secret entrance and they
would not use the front door of the house. He
peeked around the corner and saw his men turn
off at the next crossing. “Good!” he thought to
himself. They were not fooling him; it was their
intention to take a roundabout route to throw
anyone off their trail if they happened to be
followed.</p>

<p>At a rapid pace, he took a direct route to his
destination. He did not intend to go to the house;
if anything happened there, it was up to Jack and
Ken to take care of that and he knew that he could
trust them. His intention was to take up such a
position that they would have to pass him. If they
did not head for the house, then he would follow
them and spy out the secret entrance to the
house.</p>

<p>There were only three possibilities for a secret
tunnel to the house, Paul reasoned with himself.
It might be on either side or to the rear of the
house. The most probable one was at the rear of
the house because that afforded a direct connection
with very little space intervening between the two
cellars. It would be a simple thing, he thought
to himself, to dig and fortify such an underground
passage.</p>

<p>Paul hid in a doorway and waited for his
quarry to come along. In time they did and passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
within two feet of him. They were silent and
walked as though they were out for an evening
stroll. Paul hesitated ere he ventured out of his
hiding place. The neighborhood was still and
dark. If he dared to follow and keep them in
sight, he would very easily be detected; he might
have a running chance to escape, but that would
give him away and they, on the other hand,
would then realize that they were being suspected.</p>

<p>But it was not necessary for him to follow
within sight of them. He had a pretty good idea
where they were heading for. He waited for them
to round the corner and immediately he ran after
them. He peeked around the corner and saw them
stop in front of a house at about the middle of the
street. They stopped and looked all around them.
The next moment they were gone.</p>

<p>Paul flushed with excitement. He had discovered
their secret means of approach to the
house. Now all he had to do was to thread together
all the details of the mystery, put together
the puzzle into a single whole, and choose a time
when they would most probably be in the cellar
for the police to descend upon them. Paul already
foresaw the moment when the gang would be
captured and locked away where they belonged.</p>

<p>He decided to walk down the street, get a
glimpse of the house and then join his friends.
What he saw put him in a jovial mood, as he
walked back to the corner with every intention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
joining Jack and Ken. But he did not have quite
enough foresight. He had seen the group of four
break up into two pairs; he should have taken into
consideration the missing pair. Might it not be
possible that these two had headed for the same
destination by a longer route. At any rate, his
not considering that angle proved disastrous for
him.</p>

<p>Very innocently he rounded the corner and suddenly
found himself facing the protruding, round
stomach of the man he had seen as one of the
trio. Looking up into the man’s brutal face, Paul
felt himself becoming confused. In the meanwhile,
he noticed the second man take his place directly
behind him. “What are you doing around here?”
the fat man demanded in a gruff, husky voice.
“Don’t you know it is dangerous to be roaming
around at this time of night?”</p>

<p>Paul hesitated, trying hard to keep his voice
from shaking. He said, “I just took a walk, that’s
all. I live only a couple of blocks from here.”</p>

<p>“So you were just taking a walk, eh? Well,
then what were you spying around for, huh?”</p>

<p>Paul felt himself become tense. He wondered if
they would attack him. He answered, “I wasn’t
spying, Mister. I was just walking.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you look goggle eyed at every
house as you passed down the street?”</p>

<p>“Just looking as I was walking.”</p>

<p>The man squared his jaw and gritted his teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
“Some day,” he hissed, “you’ll go blind for seeing
things you ain’t supposed to. Who are you?”</p>

<p>Paul began to edge away so that he would not
have the second gangster directly behind his back.
But he was cornered and he had no way to move.
He answered, “My name is Morris Paulson.”</p>

<p>“Do you have any friends who have been
snooping around lately? They had better watch
out or they will get into heaps of trouble.”</p>

<p>Pretending that he was ignorant of the reference,
Paul said, “I don’t know what you are talking
about, Mister. My friends are nice fellows
who mind their own business.”</p>

<p>The gangster gorilla grinned mischievously.
“That’s a swell idea, everybody minding his own
business,” he remarked. “And you too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Paul agreed meekly. Feeling that
the questioning was over and that he was being
dismissed, he stepped out of the way and took a
step forward to walk away. For a fraction of a
second he congratulated himself on his luck. The
next instant, however, he felt a crash on his head.
His whole body trembled, his knees began to wobble.
As he fell to the ground he turned half way
and noticed the cruel grin on his attacker. Then
everything went dark and he knew nothing more.</p>

<p>Paul lay unconscious at the feet of the fat
gangster. The man poked his toes into the boy’s
ribs and turned him over on his back. “You
shouldn’t have hit him so hard,” the fat fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
said, addressing his henchman. “He’s only a kid.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hit hard, Boss. I only tapped him nice
and easy.” He looked pleadingly at his chief.
“What’ll we do with him?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Bind his hands and feet and throw him in one
of the empty lots.”</p>

<p>“You want me to dump him, Boss?”</p>

<p>“No!” was the snarling answer. “Do what I
say and be quick about it.”</p>

<p>Bending down, the henchman used Paul’s tie
and handkerchief to tie the boy’s hands and feet.
When that was done, he picked up the inert body
under his arm and crossed the street to an empty
lot and then dropped it to the ground. Rejoining
his boss, the two walked off. “That’ll teach him a
lesson,” muttered the fat fellow.</p>

<p>Paul did not know how long he lay there, but
he imagined that it must have been a very long
time. He tried to rise, but couldn’t. His head
ached terribly. He fell back and closed his eyes.
Gradually he regained consciousness. With difficulty,
he sat up and discovered his hands and feet
bound. At first he could not recollect exactly what
had happened to him and how he came to be in
this predicament. But little by little, events came
back to him.</p>

<p>Frantically, Paul began to work on his bonds to
free himself. But he felt weak and every time he
moved his wrist, he felt the bonds cutting his
flesh. But at last, after about twenty minutes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
tiring work, he freed his hands and it took him
but a few seconds to untie his feet. Rising, he felt
himself trembling all over. He could barely keep
himself steady on his feet. Walking, he wobbled
from one side to the other.</p>

<p>At the corner, he leaned against the wall of a
house. Suddenly he heard some shouts. He looked
to see who it might be, but his sight was blurred and
he could only see dim shadows running toward
him. Who are they, he wondered, and what do
they want from me? Was he going to be again attacked?
He wanted to run but there was no will
nor effort to do so.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Parental Admonitions</span></p>

<p>Jack and Ken commenced their search for any
sign of Paul. But everything was still and dark
and there wasn’t a sign of human life anywhere
about. After about twenty minutes of futile
searching, the two boys decided to leave and go
to Jones Street. Coming to the corner, Ken noticed
a lonely figure hovering against a wall a short
distance away. He called his friend’s attention
to it and Jack said, “Most likely a drunk. But let’s
go and see. It may be someone needing
assistance.”</p>

<p>As they neared the figure, both boys remarked
that there was something familiar about it. Jack
began to feel a little uneasy about that lonely
figure leaning against the wall and he walked
faster, Ken at his side. Soon they were both running.
“It’s Paul!” screamed Jack, almost
hysterically.</p>

<p>The two friends ran over to Paul and caught
hold of him on either side. “Paul! Paul!” whispered
Jack frantically. “How are you? What
happened to you?”</p>

<p>Paul shook his head, trying to shake away the
mist from his eyes and the dullness out of his
head. Ken whispered, “Let’s take him right home,
Jack. Don’t bother him with questions now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack nodded and agreed. He was almost in
tears at the helpless sight of his chum. Putting
their arms around their friend, they started to
lead him home. Very gradually, Paul regained his
balance and self assurance. “All right,” he muttered,
“I can walk by myself now.”</p>

<p>But just as soon as the boys removed their supporting
arms, Paul tottered and almost fell. Jack
immediately put an arm around his shoulder. A
short while later, Paul finally walked by himself.
“Some mess I got myself into,” he mumbled.</p>

<p>Jack smiled, happy that his friend was all right
again. “Now don’t talk,” he said. “Save your
energy.”</p>

<p>Paul grinned to himself thinking of how nearly
he got away. They came to his house and Jack
whispered, “How will we wake your father up?
It’s quite late already.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to wake him up for?” inquired
Paul.</p>

<p>“He has to treat your head, fellow. You’re all
bloody and messy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother him, Jack. I’ll wash up myself
and let him see it tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” insisted Jack. “You have to
be taken care of by a doctor right away. And it’s
better your father does it than anyone else.”</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t tell him what happened.
Just say I fell.”</p>

<p>Jack ran up the step to the porch and rang the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
night bell. About two minutes later, Dr. Morrison,
in his pajamas and bath robe, answered the
door. Seeing who it was, he exclaimed, “Why,
Jack, is there anything wrong?”</p>

<p>Jack thought for a few seconds what to say.
“Er, Dr. Morrison,” he began, “don’t be alarmed
but er&mdash;”</p>

<p>The doctor was impatient and he cried, “Well,
well?”</p>

<p>“You see, Paul was hurt and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” was the direct and decisive
question. “I thought he was in his room and asleep
long ago.”</p>

<p>They went around to the back of the porch.
The doctor looked at Paul’s wound and said,
“Let’s go into the office and I’ll fix you up.” The
boys followed. At the door the doctor turned to
them and said, “You go home, fellows; it’s late.”</p>

<p>Jack compressed his lips and gritted his teeth.
He wanted to ask if the wound was serious or if
there was anything he could do to help. But the
doctor seemed not to want them around. He
waited until Paul and his father entered the house
and closed the door. Ken whispered, “All right,
Jack, let’s go. There is nothing more we can do
here.”</p>

<p>Crossing the street, they separated and each
went home to sleep and to think over everything
that happened that evening.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Jack got ready to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his home. His mother called to him and asked,
“Where are you going so early? Aren’t you going
to wait for breakfast?”</p>

<p>But Jack shook his head, kissed his mother on
the cheek and ran out of the house. He was anxious
to see Paul, and, as it was too early to ring
the bell, he walked back and forth like a sentinel
in front of the Morrison house. Counting every
minute, he finally decided at eight-thirty sharp,
that it was all right to ring the bell now. He knew
that Dr. Morrison’s office hours began at nine,
and that usually he had his breakfast between
eight-fifteen and a quarter of nine. His heart
beat wildly as he heard footsteps coming to open
the door. “Good morning, Jack,” Mrs. Morrison
greeted him. “What are you doing here so early?”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Morrison. I just want to
see Paul.”</p>

<p>“Paul is a little tardy in getting out of bed this
morning,” she told him as they entered the dining
room. “Have a seat. He ought to be down any
minute.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Dr. Morrison.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Jack. Did you have breakfast
yet?”</p>

<p>“Breakfast!” Jack clasped his hand to his forehead.
“I completely forgot about it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison laughed heartily, but his wife
couldn’t see the joke and she exclaimed, “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
forgot to have breakfast! Is there anything wrong
with you?”</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison laughed and Jack shook his head.
“No,” he replied meekly. “I guess I wasn’t
hungry.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to have breakfast right now,”
insisted Mrs. Morrison. “Sit here,” she ordered
the boy and then she went to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison shrewdly remarked, with a
twinkle in his eye, “If you can forget your breakfast,
Jack, I can imagine what happened last
night.”</p>

<p>Jack moved to the edge of his seat. “How is
he?” he inquired anxiously. “Hurt bad?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he will live to get into plenty of
more trouble. Nothing to worry about.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morrison returned and placed silverware
and a plate in front of Jack. “Your bacon and
eggs will be ready right away,” she said. “In the
meanwhile, have this orange juice.”</p>

<p>Just then Paul came downstairs. He was smiling
and looked as though nothing had happened.
“Good morning, everybody,” he called cheerfully.</p>

<p>His greetings were returned. Kissing his
mother on the cheek, she noticed the bandage on
the back of his head. “What happened?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Mother. I just fell, that’s all.”</p>

<p>She looked at her husband who was smiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
“Nothing much,” he muttered to re-assure her.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she said skeptically.</p>

<p>Paul and Jack looked at each other and grinned
guiltily. “Well, sit down,” remarked Dr. Morrison,
addressing his son.</p>

<p>Weighed down by a guilty conscience, the boys
ate their breakfast in silence. Jack waited for Paul
to finish. They noted with dismay that Dr. Morrison,
although through with his morning meal, sat
by the table and read the paper. Paul said, “I’m
ready, Jack, let’s go.”</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison rose with the boys and took them
under the arm. “Where to?” he asked.</p>

<p>Paul squirmed. “Just out to the porch,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“Are you in any particular hurry? Something
very important to talk about?”</p>

<p>“No,” his son answered hesitantly.</p>

<p>“That’s fine. Do you mind coming into my office
for a couple of minutes?”</p>

<p>Jack thinking that Dr. Morrison meant only
Paul, drew away. But the doctor said to him,
“You, too, Jack. Come along.”</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison sat down at his desk and pointed
the boys to chairs. For a moment there was
silence. “Well,” remarked the doctor, “now tell
me what this is all about.”</p>

<p>The boys fidgeted. “What what’s about, Dad?”</p>

<p>“Now don’t pretend ignorance,” commented
the doctor. “You know very well what I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul turned to his companion and said, “You
tell him, Jack.”</p>

<p>Jack felt himself getting hot all over and becoming
red in the face. “No, you tell him yourself,
Paul.”</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison smiled at their uneasiness. Paul
said, “Dad, I don’t want to tell you any falsehoods
and I can’t tell you now what it is all about.
You wouldn’t understand. Please don’t ask me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to pry into your personal affairs
and have you tell me things you don’t want,”
said Dr. Morrison, “but getting a bump on the
head like that is very serious.” He paused and the
boys kept silent. The doctor continued, “I have
treated a number of such cases and I can testify to
the fact that the bumping was done by an expert.”</p>

<p>“It really isn’t much,” Paul assured his father.
“And I promise to be more careful in the future.”</p>

<p>“All right, son. You had better be&mdash;and you,
too, Jack&mdash;if you want to keep a whole head on
your shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dad.”</p>

<p>Grinning, the boys rose and left the office,
with Dr. Morrison shaking his head and wondering
what they were up to now.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">False Alarm!</span></p>

<p>Ken was sitting on the steps of the porch. He
jumped up as he heard the door open. “Hello,
fellows,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ken. You’re lucky; you always get
away with things.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble this time, Paul?”</p>

<p>“My dad just had us up at the bar and almost
made us tell.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do that. Not yet, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“For the present we got away with it,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>They went across the street to Ken’s garage
where they would have the privacy they wanted.
Seating themselves on boxes in a circle, Jack
heaved a sigh, then said, “Well, Paul, now you
can tell us everything that happened.”</p>

<p>Paul grinned mischievously. He leaned forward
and whispered, “I found out their secret entrance
to the cellar.”</p>

<p>“You mean it!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s perfect!” cried Ken.</p>

<p>“It’s in the house to the rear of the empty
house.”</p>

<p>“I had a suspicion it would be something like
that,” commented Jack. “What sort of a house
is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was dark and there was not much chance
to see anything. By the way,” he asked, “whose
idea was it to suspect the grocery man?”</p>

<p>“Mine,” answered Ken. “Was I wrong?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, you were right and you deserve
a medal as a fine detective. That man is one
of the gang.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! Well, come on, tell us about
it.”</p>

<p>Paul commenced at the very beginning and related
all that had happened to him the previous
night. Completing his narrative, Jack muttered,
“So! That’s the way things stand.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Now you tell me what happened to you
two last night.”</p>

<p>“In one word,” replied Jack, “nothing.”</p>

<p>“Tell him about the printing press,” suggested
Ken.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, but that wasn’t much. By putting
our ears to the ground, we could hear very slightly
the printing press going.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary. You should have been able
to hear it very well,” commented Paul.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it,” remarked Jack, “you’re
right. They must have muffled the noise of the
machine somehow.”</p>

<p>“They are certainly going in for it in a big
way,” said Ken.</p>

<p>“It seems that they are,” Paul replied. “Now,
if we can get a couple of things straightened out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
we can tell the story to the police and have the
gang arrested.”</p>

<p>“I think we ought to wait a while,” suggested
Jack. “It is a little too soon yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes. From every indication,” commented
Paul, “it seems that they are on the alert. We
have to catch them at a moment when they are
off their guard and make sure that every one of
them happens to be there.”</p>

<p>“There are also a couple of more things that
we have to check up on. For example, we still
don’t know how Mr. Grey fits into the picture
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot to tell you,” interrupted Paul.
“Following the grocery man, he and Mr. Grey
passed each other and nodded. Whatever that
meant I don’t know, but it establishes beyond a
doubt that they know each other and that Mr.
Grey is in with the crowd.”</p>

<p>“That’s very interesting to know,” said Jack
enthusiastically. “But in that case, how are we going
to explain his past behavior?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Paul. “But there is
no doubt that there is some connection between
his past behavior and what we are up against
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” muttered Jack, “I’d give a penny to
know exactly how those fires and the robbery fit
into the puzzle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eventually, we will solve that,” remarked
Paul. “I have a notion how they fit in but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tell us!” exclaimed Ken.</p>

<p>“I would rather not; it sounds foolish and I
may be mistaken. Besides, I couldn’t very well substantiate
my argument. But what we have to decide
now, is what we are going to do next, what
our plan of action is going to be.”</p>

<p>“Do you have any suggestion?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“My opinion is that we ought to keep away for
a couple of days. That would make them think
that they have scared us away. It will also make
them a little careless and things will be easier for
us to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now suppose we do play dead, so
to speak, for two days; then what?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Well, we still have to go down to the cellar
for a second time and establish definitely what’s
going on there.”</p>

<p>“And we still have to locate the exact position
of their secret tunnel&mdash;for it must be that,” added
Jack.</p>

<p>Paul nodded. “Yes,” he said. “It would be a
simple thing to bore a tunnel connecting the two
cellars.”</p>

<p>“But how are we going to determine how the
fires and the robbery at Professor Link’s fit into
the picture?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“For that we will have to wait and see how
things turn out,” explained Paul. “It may be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
possible that those incidents have nothing to do
with it all.”</p>

<p>“But those were the very things that we began
to investigate,” insisted Ken.</p>

<p>“Yes, and now look what it got us into,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>Suddenly the air was rent by the screech of the
fire siren. The boys leaped to their feet and began
to race down the street. “But it isn’t time yet for
another fire,” protested Paul.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, it isn’t time yet?” questioned
Ken.</p>

<p>“I told you about it. From the reports in the
papers, it seemed there was a fire approximately
every ten to fourteen days.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe this is a real fire,” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>At Main Street, the boys saw the fire engine,
a brand new one the town of Stanhope had recently
acquired, come racing madly down the
street. People were lined up along the sidewalk
watching the engine pass. “Where’s the fire?”
Paul asked someone.</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders and answered,
“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Paul asked someone else. But nobody seemed
to know where the fire was. Jack suggested that
they run down the street, in the direction the fire
engine went, and perhaps they would come upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
it. The boys agreed and they fell into a trot. On
the way, they stopped every once in a while to
inquire as to the location of the fire. But nobody
seemed to know. “That’s strange,” muttered
Jack.</p>

<p>“What’s strange?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“That no one should know where the fire is.”</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile down, they saw the
fire engine returning. The firemen waved to people
as they passed. One of the firemen shouted to
a friend at the curb, “False alarm!”</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Jack, turning to
his friends.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Paul, “I heard it. I’m just
wondering.”</p>

<p>“Wondering about what?”</p>

<p>“Just thinking of something.”</p>

<p>The boys began to walk back. For a while they
were silent. “By golly!” exclaimed Paul, slapping
his right fist into his palm. “I wouldn’t be surprised if&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped to think for a second. “If what?”
asked Ken.</p>

<p>“If that gang,” continued Paul, “were not responsible
for the false alarm.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon,” commented Ken, “you will have
that gang responsible for everything that happens
in this town.”</p>

<p>“But listen to this,” explained Paul. “Suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
they want to move something, do you think they
want any witnesses?”</p>

<p>“No, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But when you hear the fire siren, people start
running to the fire, there is a commotion, no one
would pay any attention to something being moved
in or out of a house. Isn’t that right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ken hesitantly, “but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How about going over there and looking
around?” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“No,” insisted Paul. “We said we would play
dead for two days and we are going to do it.”</p>

<p>“All right, you win.”</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Captured!</span></p>

<p>The two days were up. Jack and Ken, waiting
for Paul, sat idly about at the latter’s garage.
It was early morning, about nine o’clock and the
day was clear and warm. Soon Paul appeared and
he sat down near his friends on a box. “All right,
fellows,” he said, “what’s to be our first move?”</p>

<p>“Go down to the cellar,” suggested Jack. “It’s
early morning and probably no one will be there.
We will have at least a couple of hours in which to
look around.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and perhaps we will find the secret door,”
added Ken.</p>

<p>“Let’s go, then,” said Paul.</p>

<p>Jack picked up the baseball bat and followed.
“Again you’re bringing along your bat,” remarked
Paul.</p>

<p>“Sure. It may come in handy.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. It might not be a bad idea for
Ken and I also to take along some sort of
weapon.”</p>

<p>They stopped and looked around. Finding a
stray broom handle, Ken sawed it into three pieces
and Jack discarded his bat. Putting their weapons
out of sight, they walked off. “How will we manage
it?” asked Ken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will do it the same as last time,” suggested
Paul. “You will stay outside and keep a
careful watch while Jack and I will go down. Is
that agreeable?”</p>

<p>Ken nodded. “It’s all right with me.”</p>

<p>Before they reached the empty house, Jack suggested
that they take a look at the house in its
rear, where no doubt the secret door was situated.
His companions thought it was a good idea and
they proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>Ken took his place at one corner and Paul, by
walking around the block, took his place at the
opposite corner. When all was ready, Jack very
innocently walked down the street on the wrong
side. The house under suspicion was a one family
brick building with a stoop leading up to the front
door; at the ground level were noticeable the
small windows of the cellar. From all appearances,
the house was occupied; there were curtains in the
windows, several flower pots were distributed on
the small porch and a rubber hose lay on the
ground not far from the house.</p>

<p>As Jack reached the corner, he took over Ken’s
place and the latter strolled nonchalantly up the
street, noticing everything within sight of the
house. The boys got together again and discussed
their impressions of the house. “Very innocent
looking as far as I could see,” remarked Ken.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that fool you,” asserted Paul.</p>

<p>The boys proceeded to the empty house. Careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
not to be seen as they entered the yard, they
put their ears to the ground to find out whether
the printing press was in motion. Satisfied that
everything was quiet below as far as they could
judge they prepared for action.</p>

<p>Ken took his place prepared to watch, while
Jack and Paul moved off and entered the house.
Closing the door quietly behind them, they
entered the first room on their right. Moving
very cautiously, they approached the spot where
the trap door was supposed to be. But at first
they could not find the small piece of wood that
came out of the floor. Both boys frantically hunted
for that piece of wood. After about fifteen minutes
of digging their nails into the floor in wild
search, Jack at last came upon it and lifted it
out of the floor.</p>

<p>Paul lifted the trap door and began to descend.
Their hearts were aflutter with excitement. What
awaited them below? Would they come to trouble?
Would they come to grips with the gangsters?
Both boys had had a taste of their medicine, but
that didn’t discourage them nor were they intimidated.
Grasping firmly their short sticks, they
walked down the steps.</p>

<p>It was dark below, and that was a good sign.
Each of the boys carried a flashlight and lit up
their way. Jack closed the trap door over his head
and followed Paul. At the bottom of the stairs,
Paul waited for his friend. A beam of light went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
all around the room and came to rest on the table.
About five or six bills lay sprawled on the wooden
table. Jack whispered, “Look.”</p>

<p>Paul nodded. Together they approached the
table and looked at the money bills. There were
two fives, two tens and a twenty dollar bill.
“Counterfeit,” whispered Paul.</p>

<p>Jack picked one up and slipped it into his
pocket. They returned to the end of the room and
began a thorough search, working from one end
of the room to the other. There were several
pieces of clothing, many rags, various packages,
and other things, such as tools and machinery
about which they knew nothing. They paused to
examine the printing press very carefully. They
moved on. Jack whispered, “Let’s try to find the
secret door.”</p>

<p>Paul nodded. “It must be over the other way,”
he whispered back.</p>

<p>They proceeded to the other end of the cellar.
A beam of light moved back and forth over the
wall, but no sign of a door. They tapped and
groped at the wall but with no success. Suddenly
their hearts fell. The faint noise of footsteps on
the other side of the wall came to them. Their
minds were in a whirl. What were they to do?
Were they to be captured? If so what would happen
to them? They already had a taste of what
the gang did to anyone spying on them. What
would they do now? All these thoughts flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
through their minds in an instant. Paul whispered,
“Hide.”</p>

<p>Paul dived behind a bunch of rags and pulled
several of the rags over him. But Jack was not
so quick. At his corner, there was no ready hiding
place for him to run to. And he was still looking
for one as the electric light flashed on and
part of the middle of the wall was pushed open.
In a flash, he noticed how the door worked; the
handle of the door was pushed through on the
other side, and thus a means was left for an exit;
but on leaving, if the handle was pulled in, whoever
was in the cellar was either imprisoned or
had to use the trap door in the empty house.</p>

<p>As the door was thrown open, the two gangsters
whom Paul had noticed with the fat fellow
and the grocery man, stepped forth. Seeing Jack,
one of them whipped a revolver out of his hip
pocket. The second one, however, grabbed his
mate by the arm and exclaimed, “Don’t shoot.
He is only a kid.”</p>

<p>Advancing to Jack, the second one demanded,
“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>Jack held his breath and tried not to look in
the direction where his chum was hiding. “Just
happen to be here,” he answered, his heart in his
mouth, wondering what they would do to him.</p>

<p>The gangster became angry and boisterous. “I
know you happen to be here,” he cried as he gave
the boy a shove that sent him sprawling. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
how do you happen to be here, that’s what I want
to know.”</p>

<p>Jack picked himself up. The first man, with his
gun still in his hand, mumbled to his companion,
“Wait a minute, Pete, somebody else may be here.
Let’s look around.”</p>

<p>“Okey, Joe. Keep this fellow covered while I
look around.”</p>

<p>He took his gun out of his pocket and let his
eyes wander about the cellar. He spied the bundle
of rags. Levelling the gun at it, he cried, “If
you’re hiding there behind the rags, you better
come out or I’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>Paul thought he had better not take any chances
and slowly he rose, with his hands above his head.
Joe cried, “I think that’s the guy the boss and I
caught the other day and I socked him.”</p>

<p>Pete demanded, “Are there any more of you in
here?”</p>

<p>Paul shook his head. Out of the corner of their
eyes, the boys glanced at each other. Both were
pale and tense, but not frightened. Pete raised
his fist threateningly and scowled, “If you’re lying,
I’ll knock your block off.”</p>

<p>Paul said, “If you don’t believe me why don’t
you look around and see for yourself.”</p>

<p>That seemed to satisfy the gangster and he
lowered his arm. “What are you doing here?”
he again demanded.</p>

<p>“We came upon the trap door by accident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>”
replied Paul undaunted, “and we thought we
would look and see what it was all about.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you don’t know any more than
that?”</p>

<p>“What could we know that you don’t want us
to know?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>Pete lunged out and hit Paul on the cheek.
“That’ll teach you not to get fresh,” he hissed.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do with them?” asked the gangster
named Joe, addressing his mate. “You think
we ought to dump them?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the snarling reply. “We’ll tie
them up and leave it to the boss to do with them
as he pleases.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Joe. “They’re a
couple of rats and we ought to get rid of them.”</p>

<p>“They’re kids,” argued Pete. “We dump them
and you’ll have the cops on our tail.”</p>

<p>“The cops don’t need to know.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Tie them up and don’t argue.”</p>

<p>The two gangsters faced each other and it
seemed that they might get into a quarrel. “I say
dump them,” shouted Joe.</p>

<p>“And I say no,” snarled back Pete.</p>

<p>Jack and Paul watched them face each other,
leveling their guns. The boys thought it would be
good luck if they did fight and kill each other.
But in that case there would be shooting and they
needed safe places to run to. However, Joe, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
weaker of the two, gave in and muttered, “Okey.
We’ll tie them up.”</p>

<p>Tearing some rags into strips, Joe tied the boy’s
hands and feet and their own handkerchiefs were
used to put around their mouths. The job completed,
they were tossed into the corner. Pete,
who was watching the procedure, now said, “All
right. Now grab those two packages and take
them to the boss. And ask him what to do with
these kids.”</p>

<p>“And what are you gonna do?” Joe asked with
malice.</p>

<p>“I’m going to stay here and keep an eye on
these kids.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right with me,” said Joe. He went
to the other end of the cellar and picked up two
packages wrapped in plain brown paper. Nodding
to his mate, he called, “Okey, I’ll be going now.”</p>

<p>“And don’t take all day coming back,” snarled
Pete.</p>

<p>Joe was gone. Pete brought over a chair and
leaned it against the wall. Sitting down, he took a
penknife out of his pocket, placed his gun in his
lap and began to clean his fingernails. “It’s too
bad you kids have to pry into things you
shouldn’t,” he muttered, addressing himself to the
boys without looking at them. “It ain’t healthy.
You’re liable to get bumped off one of these days
and then where will it get you?” He paused for a
moment to think and scratch his head. “Mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
your own business is my motto,” he continued.
“If everybody would mind their own business,
everything would be all right. As it is, people get
into the trouble, like you kids, when you
shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>He stopped talking. With their hands tied behind
their backs, the boys worked feverishly to
loosen their bonds. But they had to work without
being suspected by their captor. And what’s more,
Joe had done a good and expert job. The bonds
were tied so strongly they could barely move their
wrists.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Escape!</span></p>

<p>The boys felt cramped and awkward in their
sprawling positions. The bonds cut into their
wrists and ankles. Each one worked to release his
hands, but the task was difficult. But even if they
did untie themselves, what could they do? Pete,
the gangster, sat near by with his gun in his lap.
The slightest move on their part and he would
shoot at them. They realized that they were in
a very bad predicament.</p>

<p>The gangster began his preaching again. “Now
if you kids had minded your own business,” he
said, “as you should have, you wouldn’t get into
this thing. You should have been out playing baseball
or swimming instead of snooping around.
And what do you get for it? I don’t know what
the boss is going to do to you. He may even dump
you and that’ll be too bad because you’re still
kids.” He shook his head in dismay. “You should
have minded your own business.”</p>

<p>He put away his knife and leaned back in his
chair. Taking the handle of his gun in his hand,
he glanced at the boys who seemed to be pretty
safely tied up, and then he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Waiting a few minutes, the boys continued
working on their bonds. Soon Pete began to snore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Now, if he only slept soundly for a short while
so that they could work undisturbed! But the
effort to free their hands was a very tiring process
and in ten minutes they had not accomplished
anything. Paul thought of a method. Noiselessly
he began to edge up to his friend. Pete moved and
the boys ceased their activity. He slept on, and
Paul finally managed to creep up to Jack. Placing
themselves back to back, Paul began to work on
his friend’s bonds.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, a shadow appeared at the
other end of the cellar which seemed to have
descended the stairs through the trap door. He
was so noiseless that even the boys did not hear
his footsteps. He crept forward like a cat, a veritable
shadow. Nearer and nearer he came to the
sleeping form of the gangster.</p>

<p>Paul decided to rest his fingers for a moment
and to look up at Pete to see if the gangster was
still sound asleep. Doing so, he noticed the approaching
form. His heart sank. Nudging his
friend, Jack also looked up and together they
watched the approaching form. What was he up
to? Was he friend or foe? The man put a finger
to his lips and motioned to the boys to keep utter
quiet. It mystified them. Was he after all a friend?
And all the while they had taken him for a foe.</p>

<p>The boys flushed with excitement and followed
every stealthy move of Mr. Grey, for it was he.
When he was within about a yard of Pete, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
threw himself upon the gangster. The gun clattered
to the ground. The gangster uttered a
shriek, but the next moment his face was buried
into the floor and his hands were being tied in
the back with rope that Mr. Grey took out of his
pocket. Following that, Pete’s feet were tied. The
gangster tried to turn to see who his assailant was
but Mr. Grey kept his face turned toward the
floor. Then Mr. Grey gagged and blindfolded the
gangster and left him lying in a heap where he
was.</p>

<p>The boys were breathless; they couldn’t
imagine what the man was up to. With one bound
he was at their side and untying their bonds. “It’s
a lucky thing I got here in time,” he muttered.</p>

<p>He helped them to their feet and motioned for
them to follow him. He ran up the stairs and
through the trap door. “Now run for your lives,”
he told them.</p>

<p>The boys hesitated. Paul said, “We want to
thank you for saving our lives and&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man cut him short with a wave of his hand.
“No time to lose,” he whispered rapidly. “Go.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>The man shook his head and pushed them
through the door. “Go,” he commanded them for
a second time.</p>

<p>The boys went out of the house and signalled
to Ken to follow them. But he needed no signal.
He was on the alert, waiting for them and frantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with worry. He jumped out of his hiding place
and joined his two friends. “I thought you were
goners, sure,” he cried.</p>

<p>They sprinted away down the street. “What do
you mean?” asked Jack as they ran.</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. Grey enter the house and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jack stopped dead in his tracks. “Say!” he exclaimed,
“where did he disappear to? Did you
notice, Paul?”</p>

<p>Paul shook his head. “No,” he answered. “I
guess we were so excited we didn’t notice.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Tell you later,” answered Paul. “Finish what
you started to say.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying I saw Mr. Grey enter
the house and I became frantic. I whistled and
whistled but evidently you didn’t hear me. I
couldn’t imagine what might happen to you and I
couldn’t think of anything to do or how to help.
I waited and it seemed to me like a year. I was
already preparing to go down there myself when
you two came out.”</p>

<p>“Nothing else happened?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Nothing else,” was the reply. “Wasn’t that
enough?”</p>

<p>They slowed down to a walk as they approached
Main Street. “Now tell me what happened to
you,” said Ken.</p>

<p>“Plenty happened,” remarked Paul, “but let’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
wait until we get to the garage where we can discuss
the whole thing.”</p>

<p>At their destination, they sat down to rest.
Paul and Jack heaved a sigh of relief. “What a
close shave!” exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>“Well, tell me, what happened?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>Between them, the two boys narrated the events
that befell them while Ken gasped and could
hardly believe it. When the story was all told, he
exclaimed, “Say, this thing is getting to be dangerous.
We have to do something about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Paul. “And we have to do it
quickly. In all likelihood, those gangsters are going
to return to that cellar, if they haven’t already.
Seeing that we escaped, they will probably
try to get away by tonight.”</p>

<p>“We have to move fast then,” added Jack.</p>

<p>“But what are we going to do?” asked Ken.
“What can we do?”</p>

<p>Paul leaned forward and whispered to his companions,
“The police!” It struck them all at once
that lately they had not thought of the police
who might have saved them a lot of trouble and
who were the most logical people to tell. Paul
continued, “We have to tell the police right away
before it is too late.”</p>

<p>“But wait a minute,” remarked Jack. “Do you
think they will believe us. They are liable to think
that we are inventing it all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have to convince them, that’s all there is
to it.”</p>

<p>“We most surely do,” added Ken. “There is
nothing we can do ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there are lots of things we could do
ourselves if we only thought of it,” commented
Jack. “I don’t know how wise it is to tell the
police. They may just take us for a bunch of crazy
kids.”</p>

<p>“As I said,” repeated Paul, “we have to convince
them.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how Mr. Grey fits into the situation.
I would give a penny to know,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“So would we all,” commented Paul. “But we
don’t have any time to lose, so let’s get going.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we will be able to see Chief
Bates himself?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I think I can manage that,” replied Ken. “He
knows me and I’ll ask to see him.”</p>

<p>“All right, let’s go,” said Jack.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Convincing the Police</span></p>

<p>The boys headed for police headquarters. They
undertook their task with trepidation, wondering
how they would be received, feeling that possibly
it was an unwise course to take, that perhaps if
they tried they might capture the gangsters themselves
without having to be ridiculed by unbelieving
police. And coming to think of it, all the evidence
at their command was flimsy, in many cases
unreasonable and illogical. Besides, they were
youngsters, and if they narrated all the events,
they would be considered mentally distorted. The
fact that they were perfectly normal and were sincere
and truthful was beside the point. It was
whether they would be able to convince that would
tell the tale.</p>

<p>They were very silent as they walked down
Main Street toward police headquarters. Each
one was thinking his own thoughts about the past
week. Jack asked himself what the best approach
might be. Paul tried hard to think how to narrate
the story so that it would sound convincing, and
in his mind he went over the words and phrases
that he thought would be most suitable to use.
Ken was thinking that with the police entering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
case it would be soon ended and their mystery
solved. But would it be?</p>

<p>Suppose the gang of counterfeiters were
caught, what then? The boys had started out to
solve the mystery of the white card&mdash;who was
responsible for leading Betty away to the end of
the town? Who was responsible for the fires?
Who was responsible for the robbery at Professor
Link’s? And these three things were linked together
by virtue of the white card. The boys felt
so convinced of the white card as a clue, that if
it were found to be not so, they would be badly
disappointed.</p>

<p>Jack muttered skeptically, “I hope we don’t get
thrown out before we get a chance to see Chief
Bates.”</p>

<p>Ken assured his friend, “Oh, you’ll see him all
right. The important thing is, can you convince
him?”</p>

<p>Paul laughed and joked, “Whether we convince
him or not, wouldn’t it be a fine predicament if to
crown all our effort and glory, Chief Bates throws
us into jail.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Ken.</p>

<p>“For any number of reasons,” answered Paul.
“He might put us away to cool us off. Or he
might jail us for doing detective work without a
license.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need a license to be an amateur
detective,” argued Ken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Amateur is a perfect word for it,” ironically
commented Jack. “He will think we are a bunch
of amateurs running wild.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s not anticipate his reception of us.
The chief might give us a bunch of onions for
a prize and that would be something,” remarked
Paul.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry,” exclaimed Ken. “Let’s go in for
an ice cream soda.”</p>

<p>“That’s the perfect idea,” agreed Paul. “And
I hope it will put us into the right spirit.”</p>

<p>“Most likely it will cool us off,” remarked Jack.
“But I’ll also have a soda.”</p>

<p>They entered a drugstore and ordered three ice
cream sodas. As Jack said, it cooled them off, but
it also picked them up in spirits. They emerged
smiling, cheerful, confident. The police headquarters
was a short distance away and they were soon
in front of the building. They hesitated before
entering. Each one of them felt his heart sink low
and his pulse begin to throb. Paul shrugged his
shoulders and commented, “Well, as the saying
goes, faint heart never won fair maiden. Let’s
go in.”</p>

<p>They entered the hall. At one side was a desk
with a sergeant behind it. “Yes, boys,” he called
to them, “What do you want?”</p>

<p>Ken said, “I want to see Chief Bates; my name
is Ken, Ken Armstrong.”</p>

<p>The policeman smiled patiently. “The chief is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
very busy, you know, and unless you have important
business with him, you can’t see him.”</p>

<p>Jack piped up, “Oh, it’s very important.”</p>

<p>Paul pulled his friend away. Ken said confidently,
“Oh, he will see me all right. You see, he
knows me. Just say that Ken Armstrong wants to
see him.”</p>

<p>“And what shall I say is your business with
him?” inquired the sergeant, amused at the boy’s
self confidence.</p>

<p>“It’s personal. Just say I would like to see
him.”</p>

<p>The policeman nodded and very lazily picked
up his telephone. “Hello, hello,” he called into
the speaker, “give me the chief’s office.” He
waited for several seconds, in the meanwhile looking
the boys up and down. Again he spoke into
the mouthpiece, saying, “There’s a boy here by
the name of Ken Armstrong who wants to see the
chief. Says that the chief knows him and will
surely&mdash;most surely&mdash;see him.” The policeman
scowled as he said that. Again he waited for an
answer. Several seconds later, he answered, “All
right.”</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and turned to Ken.
“I guess he knows you all right.” Ken was overjoyed
while his two friends were glad and cheerful.
“Go down to the end of the corridor,”
directed the sergeant, “and then turn left. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
door that says Police Chief, go in there and his
secretary will take care of you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Ken.</p>

<p>The three boys walked down the corridor and
turned left. They entered the office of the Chief
of Police and his secretary, a very attractive
young woman, greeted them. “Which of you is
Ken?” she asked.</p>

<p>Ken spoke up. “I am.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Have a seat and Mr. Bates will see
you in a few minutes. He is busy just now.”</p>

<p>The boys sat down and the secretary returned
to her desk and typewriter. To the boys it seemed
that she typed faster than the eye could follow.
They looked around the room and noticed the
various pictures and other office furniture. Every
moment was to them an hour. Jack was sure that
the chief would take one look at them and then
throw them out of his office. Paul wondered how
it happened Ken was acquainted with Chief Bates
and made a mental note to ask his friend about it.</p>

<p>A buzzer sounded in the room and the boys
jumped up. The secretary nodded and said, “You
can go in now, Ken.”</p>

<p>Ken proceeded toward the door, followed by
his friends. The secretary stopped them. “I
thought only Ken was going in?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he replied. “These are friends of
mine and they are coming in with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The young woman shrugged her shoulders.
“Very well,” she said, “go right in.”</p>

<p>Ken knocked on the door and someone called
loudly, “Come in.”</p>

<p>They entered. Behind a large desk toward the
rear of the room sat Chief Bates. He was a man
of about forty-five, well-set, husky and strong. He
called out, “Hello Ken. I’m glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Chief,” Ken answered, “these are
friends of mine. I hope you don’t mind&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, not at all. Pull up chairs, boys.” He
leaned back in his swivel chair. When they were
seated, he said, “Well what is it, Ken. But I warn
you, I don’t have much time, so you better talk
quickly.”</p>

<p>Ken said, “We are here to ask you a favor,
Chief.”</p>

<p>“Anything within reason, Ken,” shot back the
chief, “and I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“The favor is,” continued Ken, “that you listen
to something very, very important.”</p>

<p>“Very, very important,” added Jack.</p>

<p>Ken turned to Paul and said, “You tell him,
Paul.”</p>

<p>Paul drew up his chair and leaned on the desk.
He began, “You see, Chief, what we are going
to tell you may sound very fantastic but I want
you to believe that we are telling the truth and
that we are not inventing anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on, go on,” urged the chief, nonchalantly
leaning back in his chair.</p>

<p>“Well, to begin with,” continued Paul, “we
have discovered a gang of counterfeiters&mdash;”</p>

<p>The chief almost jumped out of his seat. He
flew forward to the desk and cried, “You have
what? What are you talking about? Are you telling
me stories or something?”</p>

<p>Paul felt his confidence shaking. He realized
that the chief was a terror and would be hard to
convince, but, he said to himself, he had to be
convinced. “You see,” he said, “already you think
we are telling you some fictionized story or trying
to shock you. Please listen, it’s very important,
and if you want to catch the gang, you have to
act quickly.”</p>

<p>“Go on, go on,” said the chief, leaning on his
desk.</p>

<p>“At 752 York Street, there is an empty house.
In the cellar of that house you will find a printing
press and all the things necessary to make counterfeit
money.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all that?” demanded the
chief.</p>

<p>“We were in there; we saw everything.”</p>

<p>“And how did you happen to be in there?”</p>

<p>The chief shot his questions like arrows and
Paul began to waver; he was becoming confused.
“That’s a long story, Chief,” he said, “and I am
trying to come to the point directly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind, tell me the whole story.”</p>

<p>“But Chief Bates, that would take too long and
it is important that you act quickly. The point of
the story is that there are a gang of counterfeiters
operating in the cellar of the empty house at 752
York Street. There is also a tunnel leading from
that cellar to the cellar of the house in the rear
of 752 York Street. That’s how they get in and
out without being noticed.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear boy,” exclaimed the chief, irritated,
“how do you know all that? Do you have
any evidence? How am I to believe that what you
are telling me is not a hoax of some sort?”</p>

<p>Jack jumped to his feet, impatient and exasperated.
“Why don’t you go down there and find
out?” he cried.</p>

<p>He shoved his hands deep into his pockets. Paul
began to say something, but the next instant Jack
jumped up and cried, “Here, here is your evidence.
Look at this. When we were down there,
there were a number of such bills on the table
and I put this one into my pocket.”</p>

<p>The chief picked up the fake five dollar bill
that Jack had thrown on the desk and examined
it carefully. He rose and walked to the door and
called to his secretary. “Tell Jim Spencer I want
to see him right away.”</p>

<p>He returned to his swivel chair and said to the
boys, “Now fellows, I am not doubting your
story; on the contrary, I think that you may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
telling the truth. But you understand that I have
to question you closely.” He paused and the boys
looked relieved; they even smiled happily. “In the
meanwhile, I do wish you would tell me the whole
story, from beginning to end, how you happened
to discover this gang and all that.”</p>

<p>Paul looked at his friends and they nodded to
him. Jack said, “Go on, Paul, tell him. But it will
take a long time, though, Chief.”</p>

<p>The Chief of Police nodded. “That’s all right.
I’m a good listener.”</p>

<p>Just then a tall, husky man entered the office
and said, “You called for me, Chief?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Take a look at this.” And the chief gave
Jim Spencer the counterfeit bill.</p>

<p>The detective quickly and expertly glanced at
the bill and announced, “It’s fake, all right, Chief.
Very clever work, though. Most likely the work
of Moonshine Charlie.”</p>

<p>“You know what these boys are telling me,
Jim?” asked the Chief. The detective shook his
head and Bates continued, “They say that they
have located the gang, have been down in their
hangout and all they want now, I guess, is for us
to step in and clean the gang up, isn’t that so,
fellows?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” cried Jack. “And you had better
hurry, too.”</p>

<p>“Very interesting,” commented Jim Spencer.
“How did they happen to discover it all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m trying to get out of
them,” answered the chief, “but it’s like pulling
teeth. Sit down and listen to the story.” To Paul,
he said, “All right, go on with your story.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began the boy, “how it all began may
sound a little fantastic. But you remember, Chief,
that a week ago today, Ken’s little sister, Betty,
disappeared for about an hour. Jack happened to
be on Leonard Street at the moment and he saw
her. He couldn’t understand what she was doing
there, but after questioning her for some time, she
told him that a tall man bought her candy and
then took her for a walk and then he left her all
alone at almost the end of the town.”</p>

<p>“And so you three became detectives and
undertook to find the man, isn’t that so?” commented
the chief, smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes, but wait a minute. This man had given
Betty a blank, white card.”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” cried Jack, and threw the card on
the desk.</p>

<p>The chief and the detective glanced at it casually.
“Go on,” said the chief.</p>

<p>“Several days later,” continued Paul, “there
was a fire on Water Street and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes. I remember that,” said the chief. “And
you very bravely ran into the burning house and
saved an old couple and an infant. That was a
very brave deed, my boy.”</p>

<p>“The important thing,” said Paul, “is that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the door of the room where the infant was, I
found another card like that.” He searched in his
pocket and produced the evidence. The chief and
the detective examined the two cards. “And to
make a long story short,” continued Paul, “there
was a robbery at Professor Link’s and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you found another such card,” said the
chief, interrupting.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But that is no evidence; it means nothing,”
said the chief. “You can find cards like these everywhere
you go, by the dozen.”</p>

<p>“Well, that may be so,” said Paul. “But to us
it was evidence, and we figured that the same man
committed all the three crimes. And we decided to
track him down.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come to us and tell us?” demanded
Chief Bates.</p>

<p>Paul was perspiring. He was very tense and he
felt that he was being hindered rather than
helped. “Well, I don’t know,” he remarked, “I
guess we didn’t think of it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t think of it!” exclaimed the chief.</p>

<p>Jack saw how his friend was suffering and he
jumped to his feet and cried, “What difference
does all that make? The important thing is that
we discovered the gang of counterfeiters and if
you don’t act quickly they will escape.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for interrupting,” said the chief,
somewhat embarrassed. “Go on with your story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we came across this man. To us he is
known as Mr. Grey. And&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And how did you come across him and how
did you know it was he?”</p>

<p>“There are a lot of little details that I’m leaving
out to make the story short. At any rate, Jack
followed him one night to the empty house at
752 York Street. We searched the house several
times until we found the secret door to the cellar.
And that’s the end of the story.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are some other things too, but we
can tell you that later.”</p>

<p>The chief and the detective eyed each other.
Detective Spencer asked, “Do you happen by any
chance to know any of the members of this counterfeit
gang?”</p>

<p>Paul nodded. “Yes,” he answered. “The fellow
they call the boss and who seems to be the chief
is a big, fat, dark featured individual. The&mdash;”</p>

<p>Chief Bates and the detective exclaimed simultaneously,
“Moonshine Charlie!”</p>

<p>“Two other men call themselves Pete and Joe.
Another member of the gang is a man who runs
a grocery store at Main and Jones Streets.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget Mr. Grey,” added Jack.</p>

<p>Paul nodded and said, “That’s right, and Mr.
Grey. That’s all we know.”</p>

<p>“That’s plenty,” cried Jim Spencer. “Where is
their hangout?”</p>

<p>“At 752 York Street; in the cellar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then they were interrupted by the entrance
of the secretary, who said, “A gentleman to see
you, Mr. Bates. He&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man was directly behind her and he said,
“Never mind telling who I am and what my business
is. I’ll do it myself.”</p>

<p>Everybody looked at the speaker. The boys
jumped to their feet as if they had been touched
by an electric spark. Simultaneously, they all cried,
“Mr. Grey!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Mr. Grey</span></p>

<p>Indeed, it was Mr. Grey. He stood there looking
at them, smiling, self-confident. By now the
chief and Jim Spencer had also jumped to their
feet. Everyone was staring speechless at the gaunt
man. Jack cried, “Who are you?”</p>

<p>The chief added, “Yes, tell us who you are and
what you want.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey walked over to the desk. Pausing for
a moment to eye the secretary, she blushed and
left the room. When the door was closed, he took
a badge out of his pocket and showed it to the
chief.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the chief. “I’m glad to meet
you.”</p>

<p>“Who is he, Chief Bates?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“A government man,” was the snappy retort.</p>

<p>“Then why did we find him among the gang?”
demanded Jack. “Anyone can get himself a badge.
Let him really identify himself.”</p>

<p>They all eyed Mr. Grey. Paul and Ken felt
horrified by Jack’s demand but they felt that he
was right, reasonable. Wasn’t it possible for him
to pass off as a government man and yet be in
reality a member of the gang? Mr. Grey said
smilingly, “That boy will some day make a very
good sleuth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you’re wrong,” retorted Jack. “I’m going
to study to be a doctor.”</p>

<p>That set everybody to laughing. Addressing
Chief Bates, Mr. Grey asked, “What have the
boys been telling you?”</p>

<p>This time Paul was on his feet. He felt that
Jack was correct in his demand that the man identify
himself further. And the fact that the man
was trying to evade it, aroused his own suspicions.
“Why don’t you identify yourself?” he demanded.
“How do we know who you are? For
all we know, you may be a member of the gang, as
we have thought right along, and only pretending
that you are a government man.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey raised his eyebrows but did not lose
any of his equanimity. He smiled and seemed perfectly
at ease. The chief remarked humorously,
“It seems that this thing has passed completely
out of my hands. So you two had better settle the
issue.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey said, “These boys are all right. No.
As a matter of fact, they are better than that.
They are shrewd, fine detectives. You ought to
acquire them for your force, Chief.”</p>

<p>He took his coat off and ripped the seam open.
Producing several papers, he handed them to
Chief Bates, who looked them over carefully.
Then Mr. Grey rolled up the sleeve of his right
arm and revealed a red gash of about two inches
long. The chief was convinced. “Good!” he exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Addressing the boys, he said, “He has
identified himself beyond any doubt.”</p>

<p>The boys were satisfied. Jack said, “All right,
now we know. But do you mind, Mr. er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Grey.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind Mr. Grey, telling us the mystery
of the white cards, your being with the grocery
man who is a member of the gang and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When the time comes, my boy,” he answered,
“you will know everything. In the meanwhile, may
I repeat my former question. What have the boys
been telling you?”</p>

<p>Chief Bates cleared his throat. With a twinkle
in his eye, he remarked, “They have been giving
me a cock and bull story about a gang of counterfeiters.”</p>

<p>“Well, it just happens to be true,” announced
Mr. Grey.</p>

<p>For a short while there was silence, as though
they were all overcome by the government man’s
statement. “Is it the Moonshine Charlie gang?”
asked Jim Spencer.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” answered Mr. Grey. “And I’m
here to ask you for ten men to round up the
gang.”</p>

<p>“Right away?” asked Chief Bates.</p>

<p>“Right away.”</p>

<p>“Jim,” said the chief, addressing his detective,
“round up ten men and get them ready. What
else, Mr. Grey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing else,” he answered. “That is, for the
present.” Addressing the boys, he said, “Well,
fellows, how do you think we ought to go about
it? But before we discuss that, may I know who
you are?”</p>

<p>Paul rose. “My name is Paul&mdash;Paul Morrison.
And I’m glad to know you, Mr. Grey.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. You fellows have done some very
good work.”</p>

<p>“And this is Jack Stormways,” introduced
Paul.</p>

<p>The two shook hands. Jack remarked, “I’m
not going to say I’m glad to know you, but rather
glad to meet you. After having followed you so
much, I think I know you by now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey smiled. “Yes,” said Mr. Grey, “you
have followed me around a great deal and rather
expertly, too.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Jack, grinning with pleasure.</p>

<p>“And this is Ken Armstrong.”</p>

<p>The two shook hands. “Now,” said Mr. Grey,
“how are we going to finish the job and capture
the gang? What’s your idea, fellows?”</p>

<p>Paul said, “I guess you ought to know that
better than any of us. We will leave that to you.”</p>

<p>“Just one favor,” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“May we go along? I’d like to be in on it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey and the chief exchanged glances. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
chief shook his head. “It’s going to be dangerous,”
remarked Mr. Grey.</p>

<p>“Any more dangerous than what we have
already done?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“There may be shooting. And you might get
hurt.”</p>

<p>“I guess we could keep out of the way. We
might keep in the background.”</p>

<p>“Well,” conceded Mr. Grey, “if the chief has
no objections, I’ll get you into action somehow.”
The chief shrugged his shoulders. “After all,”
he commented, “who am I to deny them their
fun?”</p>

<p>“That’s swell,” cried Jack.</p>

<p>Just then, Detective Spencer returned to the
office and announced that everything was ready.
“I’ll tell you what you can do first, boys. Suppose
Paul and Ken and two officers go down to the
grocery store at Jones Street and arrest Harriman,
the grocery man. If he isn’t in the store, he
is upstairs, in the first room on your right.”</p>

<p>“And what am I going to do?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“You will come with me,” said the government
man.</p>

<p>The boys rose. “Are we all ready?” asked the
chief. “Because I’m also going along.”</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me,” said Mr. Grey, “I
don’t think you should.”</p>

<p>“All right. If you insist.”</p>

<p>“For best interest all around.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief nodded. Addressing the boys, he
said, “Well, fellows, it seems that you were right
and I want to apologize for questioning you and
doubting you. And let me tell you that I appreciate
everything you have done and I shall see to it that
you are in some small way rewarded.”</p>

<p>The boys beamed with delight. Mr. Grey remarked,
“They certainly deserve it, Chief. You
ought to make them honorary members of your
force.”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s a serious thing,” answered Chief
Bates hesitantly. “But I shall certainly consider
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, goodbye,” said Ken. “Thanks for listening
to our story.”</p>

<p>“The thanks is all on my side,” returned the
Chief. “And good luck.”</p>

<p>They left the office. In the waiting room, Mr.
Grey whispered something in the secretary’s ear
and she blushed and waved him away. In the corridor,
they walked to the rear of the building,
where autos and policemen, armed, waited for
them. Mr. Grey gave the necessary orders, and
with screaming sirens, they were off.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Paul Helps Out</span></p>

<p>Paul and Ken had entered a large automobile
with three detectives. One was driving, while the
other two talked to the boys. The other cars
went west to drive, at the direction of Mr. Grey,
a roundabout way. The single auto drove along
Main Street. The driver did not use his siren, preferring
to proceed quietly and arouse no curiosity.
Detective Walters, who was in charge of the detail
asked Paul, “You know this fellow Harriman,
the grocery store keeper, don’t you? You could
easily identify him, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, very easily.”</p>

<p>“Fine, then you and I will enter the store and
pick him up. As for you boys,” meaning his fellow policemen,
“one of you will cover the front of
the house, and the other, the rear of the house.
As for you, young fellow,” and he addressed Ken,
“you know how to drive a car, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I drive my dad’s car all the
time.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. You stay in the car. Get behind
the wheel and if there is any chasing to do, you
will drive the car. Everybody now knows what he
is to do?” he asked, looking from one man to the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer of all of them.</p>

<p>The boys felt excited. They liked the way Walters
treated them. They felt as though they were
members of the force with certain jobs assigned
to them. They looked forward to doing as well
as they could.</p>

<p>The next moment the car came to a halt at the
corner across from the grocery store. Paul immediately
jumped out of the car with the detectives
and Ken at once took his place behind the steering
wheel. The detectives carried no rifles as they did
not wish to arouse suspicion. They were merely
armed with their service revolvers which they
held ready in their coat pockets.</p>

<p>Walters waited for his mates to take their
places and then he nodded to each one of them in
turn. To Paul, he whispered hurriedly, “In case
of trouble, take shelter right away; get out of the
way of the line of fire. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was his meek reply.</p>

<p>Paul felt a wave of excitement. He felt a little
anxious and hoped everything would pass off
quietly without anyone coming to harm.</p>

<p>Walters, with Paul at his side, started to cross
the street toward the grocery store. They
mounted the sidewalk and approached the door.
Suddenly a shot rang out, fired, so it seemed to
Paul, point blank at them. Immediately Walters,
with his left hand, shoved Paul to one side and
sent him sprawling. As for himself, he dodged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
behind the wall. Evidently, the grocery man had
seen them coming and had realized who they
were and what they were up to. And it further
seemed that he did not intend to give up without
a violent struggle. Walters shouted, “Come on
out or we are coming in to get you.”</p>

<p>For an answer another shot rang out. Harriman
meant business and no fooling. Walters signalled
to his fellow detectives covering the front
of the house and the man crawled across the street
to the car at the curb. “Duck,” he said to Ken.</p>

<p>Ken complied and lowered himself in the car.
The detective took out two rifles, a couple of
boxes of ammunition which he shoved into his
pocket and a square box. With this load he crept
back into position. Suddenly Walters ran across
the front of the store and joined him. The next
instant a shot rang out. But it was too late. Walters
was safe and sheltered by lying flat on the
ground behind the curb. “Come on out,” he called
for a second time, “or we’ll give you the works.”</p>

<p>Again the answer was a shot. Walters picked
up a small stone lying nearby, and, without raising
himself, threw it and shattered the window.
Several shots rang out and Walters and his mate
returned the fire just to impress the gangster.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the detective who covered
the rear of the house, had also run back of the
car, got himself a rifle, a box of cartridges and a
square box similar to the one taken by his fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
detective. In an instant he returned to his
position.</p>

<p>Walters shouted, “Harriman, if you don’t
come out willingly, you’ll be carried out.”</p>

<p>No answer. For several tense moments there
was silence. A number of people had collected on
the opposite sidewalk and Ken waved to them to
get out of the way. The next moment he tore open
the square box and took out what looked like a
baseball and threw it into the store through the
broken window. There was an explosion and a
cloud of smoke rose. An instant later, two women
burst through the door; they were coughing frantically
and rubbing their eyes. One of the women
was the wife of the grocery man, the other a customer
who by chance had happened to be in the
store at the moment. Walters shouted to them,
“This way. Come here.”</p>

<p>The other detective took the two women and
led them to the automobile. “Stay here,” he told
them.</p>

<p>Taking out his revolver, he gave it to Ken and
said, “Now be careful. Keep the women here and
don’t let them get away. You understand?”</p>

<p>Ken gripped the weapon and nodded, “Yes,
sir.”</p>

<p>The detective then stole back to his position.
But just then, a cry arose from the rear of the
house. Harriman appeared at the back of the
house and was surprised by the detective who now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
shouted to Walters the news. Walters left his
mate to cover the front and ran to the empty lot
adjoining the corner house. Harriman, in an effort
to escape the tear gas inside the store, rushed
out of the rear door and took a position behind a
cluster of bricks that seemed to form a very
natural fortress. He was cornered, but it seemed
that he refused to surrender without a violent
struggle. It also seemed that he was very well
armed, having two revolvers and plenty of
ammunition.</p>

<p>Shots continued to ring out in an exchange of
fire. Walters looked around for a way of getting
at the gangster’s rear. There was only one way
and that was through the house. But immediately
Walters realized that to move out of his shelter
behind a tree would take him into the open and
make of him a very simple target. It occurred to
him that he was now just as well cornered as his
prey and that the only alternative was to shoot it
out, unless of course the detective left to guard
the front of the house took the initiative and got
at Harriman’s rear.</p>

<p>Now let us see what happened to Paul in the
meanwhile. When Walters pushed him and sent
him sprawling, he was on the side of the house
facing Main Street. He wondered what he could
do. His investigation several days before had
revealed to him the door at the rear of the house.
But he thought that the grocery man, realizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the odds against him, would certainly surrender.
He had no idea that Harriman would be so stubborn
and defy the policemen. But he did. And the
more Paul waited for the gangster to surrender,
the more he realized that the grocery store keeper
was bent on violence. After the barrage of tear
gas and the cry announcing the gangster at the
rear of the house, he lifted himself slightly off
the ground and made sure of the exact spot where
Harriman had barricaded himself.</p>

<p>Thinking quickly, he rushed to the corner and
waved to the detective, hoping that the man would
understand what he was up to. The next moment
he rushed into the hall of the house where the
stairs were leading upstairs. He figured that there
must be a door leading from the hall into the
store. But he didn’t want to get into the store.
And he tried to think how Harriman had escaped
from the store to the rear of the house. He looked
around. There was only one door at the end of
the hall. Approaching noiselessly, he pulled the
door open. To his complete amazement, he was
directly behind the gangster who was absorbed by
the fire of the detectives. Without hesitating or
giving Harriman a chance to realize his danger,
Paul let out a most horrible shriek and threw
himself on the gangster. Harriman looked up,
his face pale and frightened. He turned to fire at
Paul, but it was too late. The boy was already on
top of him and pinning his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Harriman was a bulky, strong individual. With
Paul on top of him, he rose and was on the point
of whirling his assailant off. But by this time the
two detectives were also on top of him and pinned
his arms. Paul slipped off the gangster’s back. In
an instant Walters slapped handcuffs on the gangster.
Turning to Paul, he cried, “You fool!”</p>

<p>Paul smiled and appeared quite calm and confident.
Walters slapped him on the back and together
they escorted the criminal to the automobile,
while the other detective began to pick up
Harriman’s guns and ammunition.</p>

<p>Siren screaming, Ken drove the car down Main
Street and to police headquarters. Chief Bates
met them and congratulated them on their capture.
“Any trouble, boys?” he asked.</p>

<p>Walters smiled and said, “It seems, Chief, that
we couldn’t get along without these youngsters.”
He pointed to Paul, and asked, “Do you know
what he did, this kid?”</p>

<p>The chief shook his head and asked, “What did
he do? Get into trouble again or something?”</p>

<p>“Well, if it wasn’t for him,” was the answer,
“we would still be there pegging away at each
other. That kid up and jumped the gangster. All
we had to do was to take him into custody.”</p>

<p>The chief laughed uproariously. “Some detectives
you are!” he exclaimed. “Letting a kid do
your work!”</p>

<p>“I tell you, Chief, there is no getting away with
it&mdash;these kids are the tops,” said Walters, slapping
Paul on the back.</p>

<p>“But seriously, though,” remarked the chief,
“I don’t want you fellows to get into any trouble.
Do you hear me?” he demanded, pretending he
was being tough on them. “You have done enough
and I want you to keep out of harm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul smiled. “All right, Chief,” he said. “Did
you hear from the others?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” he answered. Addressing his
detectives, he said, “You boys better run down
there and give them a hand if they need it.”</p>

<p>“May we go along?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“All right. I guess these detectives of mine
wouldn’t be able to find the place or know what
to do without you.” They all laughed heartily.
“But don’t get into more trouble, do you hear me,
you two?”</p>

<p>The three detectives and Paul and Ken got
into the car and rode off. At their destination,
they came upon a pitched battle. It seemed that
the gang was a tough bunch and ready to battle
the law rather than surrender in spite of the
heavy odds against them.</p>

<p>At the corner of York Street, when the police
cars arrived, they stopped and Mr. Grey had
issued instructions. Four of the detectives he instructed
to take up varying positions across the
street from the house which led to the secret
door. Accompanied by three more policemen and
Jack, he went to 752 York Street. The detectives
he told to deploy around the house and Jack he
warned to keep out of the way. On second
thought, he turned to Jack and said, “You go back
there and watch those automobiles.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Jack went to obey and sat himself
in the second car. He wanted to be in on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
action, but he realized why the government agent
wanted him out of the way.</p>

<p>The detectives were armed with rifles and sub-machine
guns. Mr. Grey looked around to see if
all his men were in position. He gave the signal
for all of them to be on the alert. Gripping
his revolver, he entered the empty house and left
the door open. Noiselessly, he opened the trap
door and descended the stairs. The cellar was lit
up and that told him that the gangsters were
there. As far as he knew, Joe and Pete were surely
there, but he didn’t know whether Moonshine
Charlie himself was there. He paused to listen,
and only the voices of the two reached him. For
several seconds he debated with himself whether
to wait until the arrival of the boss. On the other
hand, he thought, he might seize the two and then
let Moonshine Charlie walk into a trap.</p>

<p>Descending noiselessly, he came to the bottom
of the stairs. The two gangsters were at the table,
Pete with his right side toward Mr. Grey and Joe
having his back toward the agent. Mr. Grey
levelled his gun and muttered threateningly, “Put
your hands up, boys. Quick. Reach for the ceiling
and no monkey business.”</p>

<p>The two gangsters jumped to their feet and
put their hands up above their heads. Pete cried,
“What the&mdash;What’s all this about?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out right away,” was the answer.
Mr. Grey saw them edging toward the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the table and he warned them, “Don’t you move
or I’ll plug you.”</p>

<p>But the next instant Pete turned over the table
with his leg and the two gangsters threw themselves
behind it. Mr. Grey fired, the bullet burying
itself in the wooden table. Pete fired back and the
government agent threw himself on the floor and
crept behind the stairs for protection. “The house
is surrounded,” he told them. “You had better
surrender if you want to get out alive.”</p>

<p>Pete tossed back, “Like hell!”</p>

<p>He fired and Mr. Grey returned. Pulling the
table along, they moved gradually back toward
the secret door. The government agent realized
that their escape through the tunnel into the next
house was safe and sure; there was nothing he
could do about it. So he let them work their way
gradually back. Joe raised his arms to pull open
the door and the next moment he grabbed it away,
letting out a yell. Mr. Grey had fired and the bullet
had pierced the gangster’s hand. But the door
was now ajar, and in a moment they pulled it
open and escaped.</p>

<p>Mr. Grey ran forward and whatever he could
find, he piled up against the door, shutting off
their return into the cellar. The gangsters were
now trapped in the second house. The government
man ran up the stairs, and cautiously
emerged from the house, to make sure his own
men did not fire on him. Coming out into the open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
he directed his men to close up on the house.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the gangsters, realizing that
their escape was cut off at both ends, set up sub-machine
guns at both ends of the house and began
to rake every inch of ground within sight. The
detectives got busy. Several of them used their
own sub-machine guns. Others, picking up stones
wherever they found them, managed to break
every window in the house.</p>

<p>The detectives ripped open the square boxes and
began to throw tear gas into the house through the
open windows. Several of the bombs fell short of
the house, and pretty soon the whole house was enveloped
in thick clouds of smoke. There was no
wind and the smoke hung in the air in and around
the house. Within five minutes, both gangsters
stumbled out of the doorway, coughing hard and
trying hard to keep their hands above their heads.</p>

<p>Several of the detectives immediately ran forward
and grabbed them, at the same time dragging
them away from the clouds of tear gas. They
were immediately surrounded and handcuffed.
Just then a siren screamed and everyone turned to
see what was happening.</p>

<p>Jack was sitting in the car and watched the
battle. He was glad now that he was at a safe
distance. It was too bloody an affair for him.
After a while, he leaned back in the seat and paid
no attention to what was going on. He waited for
the finish and for the detectives to return. He heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the crackling of rifle fire and the explosion of bombs.</p>

<p>Resting in the back seat of the automobile he
only hoped that no one would be hit and that all
would turn out well. Why couldn’t the gangsters
give up, he thought to himself. Couldn’t they see
that the odds were against them? And even if they
should escape this time, which was impossible,
they would still be hunted and caught by the police
of some other town or city.</p>

<p>Jack leaned forward and peeked out of the
window. He caught his breath and became tense.
There was a man across the street who looked
very familiar and appeared to be exceedingly interested
in the battle that was going on between
the criminals and the police. The man, tall, fat,
husky, stood in front of a roadster that evidently
belonged to him. “Moonshine Charlie,” Jack
thought to himself.</p>

<p>Yet he had not heard the man drive up. It was
because he was absorbed in his own thoughts.
Now what am I to do? What can I do? These
questions came to Jack’s mind, yet he found no
answer. It was no use to call one of the detectives;
the gangster might disappear in the meanwhile.
What could he do?</p>

<p>Jack became conscious of the fact that the firing
had ceased. He saw the fat man get into his
car and drive off, turning into the next corner.
Jack jumped to the wheel, set off the siren screaming
and was immediately chasing the gangster.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Into the Lake</span></p>

<p>The detectives were startled by the sound of
the siren but it immediately put them on their
guard. Seeing the car which Moonshine Charlie
was driving, tearing down the street, they thought
something was wrong and they threw themselves
to the ground. The gangster was bent on revenge,
though there was little he could do. His plan evidently
was to drive by the group of detectives,
and through the open window of his car, fire on
them as he passed. It was a violent gesture, born
of hate and contempt.</p>

<p>The detectives threw themselves on the ground,
dragging the two gangsters down with them.
Moonshine Charlie fired four or five times as he
sped by, but all his shots were futile and hurt
no one. However, Jack was only a couple of yards
behind him. The boy slowed down as he came
alongside a group of policemen. Mr. Grey jumped
forth and leaped onto the running board.
“Drive!” he cried.</p>

<p>The car leaped forward and flew out of sight.
The gangster kept speeding straight ahead. Jack
kept his siren screaming and hoped no one would
get in his way. Mr. Grey assured himself of a firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
hold and then turned his attention to the fleeing
automobile ahead of him. The police car was
much more powerful and Jack was gaining gradually.
Mr. Grey aimed and then fired, but with no
result.</p>

<p>Moonshine Charlie turned the next corner on
two wheels. Jack was after him. The gangster
began to zigzag and that was to his disadvantage
because that enabled Jack to gain considerable
distance on him. Mr. Grey fired a second time,
but again, the shot had no effect. Suddenly Jack
caught his breath. Moonshine Charlie had turned
a corner. The boy knew that it was a dead end
street and unless the gangster slowed up, the car
would run straight into the lake.</p>

<p>Jack slowed up as he turned the corner. Mr.
Grey of course did not realize why, but as soon as
the corner was turned, he saw for himself. The
gangster didn’t know it was a dead end street. It
was too late when he realized it. Slamming on the
brakes, the car seemed to shiver and bounce into
the air. Evidently Moonshine Charlie had lost
control of his machine, for it ran onto the sidewalk,
almost crashed into the brick wall of a
house, and then leaped through the wooden fence
and into the lake.</p>

<p>Jack pulled the car up to the curb and stopped.
Mr. Grey and he rushed up to the lake. The terrible
splash of the water caused by the plunging
automobile was already becoming calm. Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
stared at the approximate spot and shivered. Mr.
Grey asked, “Anything wrong, fellow?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the meek answer. There was a short
silent pause, then he remarked with deep feeling,
“It’s a terrible death.”</p>

<p>The government agent nodded silently, then
replied, “He lived a terrible life.”</p>

<p>By now a crowd had gathered and several reporters
and photographers had arrived. Mr. Grey
and Jack pushed their way through and drove off
again. “Shall we go back and see if the men are
still there?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. Grey nodded. “Yes, let’s go back.”</p>

<p>For a short while they drove along in silence.
Jack felt so shaken by the incident that he drove
the car at a very slow pace. The agent commented,
“It’s a good thing you happened to be there
on the spot, or else he would have gotten away and
might also have wounded some of the men.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jack ironically, “I thought I
was safely out of it when bang, there. I was right
in it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey regained his good humor and
laughed. “It seems that we can’t get along without
you fellows. You boys have done more in the
capture of the gang than I and the detectives did.
I wonder if they got Harriman all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose they had any difficulty,” was
Jack’s opinion.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” was the contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
opinion. “Harriman was a violent sort of person,
very temperamental and brutal. But for that matter
they all were. A tough bunch they were.”</p>

<p>They arrived at the scene of the battle. The
change was now so vastly different, that Mr. Grey
commented upon the fact, “Suddenly, everything
is again quiet and serene. Isn’t it wonderful?”</p>

<p>Jack was silent. There was no one in view and
they assumed that the detectives with their prisoners
had returned to police headquarters. Mr.
Grey suggested that they enter the house and see
what was inside. Jack had no objection and together
they mounted the few steps to the porch
and entered the house. The door opened on a
small foyer, with stairs leading up to the rooms
above. On their left was a door which Mr. Grey
opened and they entered. The room was fairly
well furnished as a living room, but now, after the
battle, it was in considerable disorder.</p>

<p>They went from room to room and then upstairs.
They were all fairly well furnished. Except
for the two rooms which were used by the gangsters
in their struggle with the police, the furniture
was not at all disturbed. Jack asked, “Did
the gangsters occupy this house?”</p>

<p>“In a fashion. But they didn’t live here,” the
agent informed him. “Actually they lived at the
hotel, but they used this house from which to
carry on their operations. Let’s go, shall we?”</p>

<p>They returned to their car and drove back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
police headquarters. There they found that the
prisoners had been brought in and put in jail; not
one of the detectives had been hurt. The chief
greeted them and shook Mr. Grey’s hand. “Great
work,” he said, “great work. Did you get Moonshine
Charlie?”</p>

<p>The government agent shook his head sadly
and replied, “No, I’m sorry to say I didn’t.” He
turned to Jack for confirmation. “You see,” he
continued, “he got away. We were just about to
grab him when phizz, up he goes and jumps into
the lake.”</p>

<p>“Jumps into the lake!” exclaimed the chief.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer. “You see, he was going
so fast, he couldn’t stop himself.”</p>

<p>“He fell in, car and all,” added Jack.</p>

<p>Chief Bates heaved a sigh of relief. “Whew!
For a moment you had me thinking that he actually
got away.”</p>

<p>“Well, he did,” insisted Mr. Grey. “He got
away so cleanly, no one will ever catch him
again.”</p>

<p>The chief and the detectives laughed. Catching
sight of Jack, the chief pulled him forward and
shook him by the hand. “I already heard of what
you did, fellow,” he said. “That was very bravely
done.”</p>

<p>“As I was telling him just before,” commented
Mr. Grey, “I don’t know what we would have
done without him and his friends. They did more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to capture the gang than all of us put together.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear all of it,” exclaimed the chief.
“Did you hear what his friend, Paul Morrison,
did?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded and wondered what Paul had been
up to now. “What this fellow, Paul, did?” continued
the chief. “He went with three men to take
Harriman into custody. Well, this fellow put up
a tough battle. To make a long story short, he
came out of the rear of his store, barricaded himself
and fired shot for shot. They might still be
there shooting it out if it wasn’t for this fellow.
He sneaked up on his rear, jumped the gangster,
and bingo! there he was all captured and no
longer tough and fighting.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey laughed heartily. “These fellows,”
he remarked, “are showing us all up. Did I say
before you ought to make them honorary members
of your force? I take it back. They would
show your men up so, the whole force would soon
be plagued with an inferiority complex.”</p>

<p>The chief roared and slapped his knee. “That’s
a good one,” he cried.</p>

<p>Jack said, “By the way, where are Ken and
Paul?”</p>

<p>“They are in the detectives’ room. Shall I call
them? Do you want them?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s about time we went home.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grey laughed. “Notice how calm and nonchalant
he is and with what poise he said that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>”
commented the government agent. “The job is
done, nothing else to do, so it’s about time to go
home, just like that.”</p>

<p>Jack blushed and Chief Bates laughed. “Well,”
he said, “there is really no reason why the boys
should not go home.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. I think they deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” The chief winked to the government
agent. “I think I will send them home in an official
car.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t necessary at all,” cried Jack.
“We can just as well walk home.”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet as if he intended to leave.
“Now you just sit there,” said the chief. Opening
the door of his office, he called his secretary to
have the boys come in.</p>

<p>Chief Bates and the government agent continued
their joking. A minute later Jack and Ken and
Walters entered. “Oh, there you are,” cried Paul.
“We didn’t know where you were and what happened
to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Ken, “we were waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“Well, here I am,” Jack informed his friends,
“and I think it’s time we went home.”</p>

<p>Chief Bates, addressing the detective, said,
“Walters, will you please take the boys home?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t necessary at all,” cried Paul.
“Thanks all the same. But we can walk home.”</p>

<p>“Notice the modesty of them,” remarked Mr.
Grey. “It’s really funny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief laughed. “All right,” said Walters,
“if you’re ready, let’s go.”</p>

<p>Chief Bates came around the desk and shook
hands with them. “Any time I can do anything
for you boys,” he said seriously, “don’t forget
to call on me.”</p>

<p>“And when you want some good detective work
done,” intervened Mr. Grey, “you call on them.”</p>

<p>The boys were beginning to feel uncomfortable.
The government agent rose and approached them.
“Well, boys,” he said, “it was a real pleasure to
work with you.” He paused for a second, then
added, “The only trouble of collaborating with
you is that you do all the work and leave the other
fellow nothing to do.”</p>

<p>There was laughter all around. Then Jack said,
“Mr. Grey, you must not forget that we want to
talk some things over with you. There are a couple
of mysterious details that we think, you can
clear up for us.”</p>

<p>The man bowed low and replied, “I am at your
disposal, sir.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you might visit us tonight at my
house,” added Paul. “Then you could tell us everything.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” nodded Ken. “How about it?”</p>

<p>“I shall be there at eight sharp, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>The boys smiled at the man’s behavior. He was
really lots of fun. They said goodbye all around
and left, accompanied by Walters.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Trouble at Home</span></p>

<p>The boys got into the official car with Walters
at the wheel. Jack and Ken sat in the back while
Paul sat in the front with the driver. Paul remarked,
“Now that all that is done, our real work
begins.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Do you remember what we originally started
out to solve?” Paul asked.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of that,” muttered Jack.
“We have gotten as far away from the original
mystery as we could.”</p>

<p>“What are you kids talking about?” asked
Walters.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Paul for the detective’s information,
“we happened to discover the gang of counterfeiters
by....”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me that it was you
fellows who discovered them!” exclaimed the detective.</p>

<p>“Well, in a small way, yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s a rich one,” was Walters’ retort. “But
go on with what you were saying.”</p>

<p>“What I was going to say,” continued Paul,
“was that some maniac has been roaming through
town and doing things, always leaving a white
card to mark his visit there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t say!” remarked Walters. “And
you’re trying to track him down?”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“How did you find out about this fellow with
the white card?”</p>

<p>“Well, do you remember when Ken’s little sister,
Betty, was reported missing for about an
hour and then turned up again?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I remember the case. And I don’t
think anything was done about it.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Paul. “But that’s how we began
our investigation that led up to the discovery of
752 York Street.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s very interesting,” commented the
detective. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Jack found her all the way out
on Leonard Street. Questioning her, she told him
that a man bought her candy and then took her
for a walk and left her there.”</p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p>“Well, the man also gave her a white card. And
that’s how our investigation began.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” cried Jack, flushed with excitement.
“Do you remember that all along we
have been thinking that Mr. Grey was that man
and that is why we were following him and all
that, just waiting to jump on him?”</p>

<p>Ken exclaimed, “Why that is right, come to
think of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Walters laughed. “So Mr. Grey is the guilty
party. That’s good.”</p>

<p>And he laughed some more. “What are we going
to do, Paul?”</p>

<p>“We will just have to ask him, I guess,” was
the reply. “I imagine he will be able to clear up a
lot of details for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ken, “but you don’t think he was
responsible for the fires and the robbery at Professor
Link’s, do you?”</p>

<p>“What about the fires and that robbery you are
talking about?” asked Walters.</p>

<p>“We found that there have lately been more
than an average number of fires in town.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the detective. “I remember
that Captain Bob has spoken to the chief
about it and I think that a detective has been put
on the case. I’ll find out who it is and tell him to
look you up.”</p>

<p>The detective treated it as a good joke. While
he was still laughing Paul remarked, “Yes, send
him over. We may be able to give him some valuable
information.”</p>

<p>The detective was still more amused and the
boys laughed too. “That’s right, Walters,” echoed
Ken, “some day when you have a case you can’t
solve, call on us.”</p>

<p>“I think we have been talking too much,” replied
the detective.</p>

<p>The car pulled up to the curb in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Morrison home. Paul and Ken, who lived across
the street, jumped out. They waved to Jack and
Walters as the car sped away to deliver the last
of the trio home.</p>

<p>Paul rushed into the house and upstairs to his
room. His mother as yet knew nothing about her
son’s adventure. Later on, she called him to dinner.
Dr. Morrison walked in. Seeing his son, he
exclaimed, “Well, well! Permit me to congratulate
you, my boy. I didn’t know we had a hero in
the family.”</p>

<p>Paul blushed and became very busy with his
grape fruit. Mrs. Morrison asked innocently, “A
hero in the family? What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison waved a newspaper. “Just take
a look at the evening paper and you’ll see. His
picture is in there and the whole story of how he
and his friends captured a gang of counterfeiters.”</p>

<p>Paul’s head sunk lower. So his picture was in
the paper! He wondered how the reporters got it
and whether Jack’s and Ken’s pictures were also
in the paper. He was itching to read what the
papers had to say about the affair. But his mother
grabbed the newspaper and read it breathlessly.
A minute later she looked up and demanded,
“Paul Morrison! Will you please tell me what
this is all about?”</p>

<p>Paul shook his head meekly. “Why nothing,
Mother,” he whispered. “It just happened that
I....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>He faltered and his mother said, “It just happened!
I will be very glad to see you go off to
college. You will be too busy there to get into
mischief.”</p>

<p>But the next moment she smiled sweetly and
and came around the table and kissed him. Dr.
Morrison was beaming. He had always been
proud of his son. He said, addressing his wife,
“He is all right; he is one boy who can take care
of himself.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of that,” answered Mrs. Morrison,
“but for my peace of mind I wish he would keep
out of trouble. I hope college will do that&mdash;keep
him out of mischief.”</p>

<p>Just then the maid entered and announced that
Paul was wanted on the telephone. He went into
the foyer and picked up the receiver. It was Jack.
“Hello.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Paul. Are you in trouble with your
family about the affair?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Well, so am I. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Paul went back to the dining room. His father
said, “Now, since you were a participant, do you
mind telling us a few of the details?” So Paul
started in to relate the whole story.</p>

<p>At the Armstrong home, it happened a little
differently. Ken entered the house and went to
wash up. Soon his father returned home from the
office, carrying an evening paper. Looking around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
for his son, he found the boy in the library reading
a story to his little sister Betty. Mr. Armstrong
walked in, stood over the boy for several
seconds, pretending that he was going to give him
a good verbal thrashing, then exclaimed, “So! So
you have decided to become a detective!”</p>

<p>“What’s a defective?” Betty asked innocently.</p>

<p>Ken and his father burst out laughing. Mr.
Armstrong bent down and said to the child, “Detective,
honey. The word is detective.”</p>

<p>Ken still laughed. He thought his little sister
was cunning in the way she had said it. Turning
to his son, Mr. Armstrong asked, “Well, what is
it all about?”</p>

<p>“What does the paper say?” asked Ken.</p>

<p>“Here, see for yourself.” And Mr. Armstrong
gave the evening paper to his son. “Your picture
is in it and Chief Bates is quoted as saying that
you were real heroes. Imagine it, my son a hero!”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s wrong with that, Dad?” asked
Ken.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Armstrong entered.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong said, “Will you come here a
second, Mother? I want to tell you something.”
She came into the library. “Did you know that
your son is a hero?” asked her husband.</p>

<p>“What did he do now?” she inquired calmly.</p>

<p>“Give your mother the newspaper, Ken.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong took the paper and glanced
at the headlines and the pictures. She said calmly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
“Nothing surprises me. What these boys can’t
get into has not been invented yet. Come to
dinner.”</p>

<p>They rose to comply. Mr. Armstrong put an
arm around the boy’s shoulder and said, “You’re
all right, son. But I do hope college will tame you
and your friends a bit.”</p>

<p>They went into the dining room. When they
were about half through the meal Ken was called
to the telephone. It was Jack. “Hello, Ken.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack. What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Are you having trouble with your family
about that affair?”</p>

<p>“No, not really. My father and mother took it
very well.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Jack’s reception had been different. When he
got into the house, he found his mother waiting
for him. One of the neighbors, who had been out
shopping returned home with an afternoon newspaper.
She immediately ran over to show Mrs.
Stormways the headlines and the pictures of Jack
and his friends. Jack’s mother first became frightened,
and was on the point of calling Chief Bates
to inquire further into the matter. But then she
thought it would be better to wait until her son
returned. It was evident that no harm had come
to him, or it would have been in the paper.</p>

<p>She waited for her son. At last he came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
she asked him, “Well, Jack Stormways, what is
this all about?”</p>

<p>“What is what about, Mother?”</p>

<p>He really did not know that the story was in
the afternoon papers and that his mother knew
the situation. She showed him the paper with the
headlines and the pictures. His first comment was,
“Not such a bad picture of me and the boys, is it,
Mother?”</p>

<p>The remark took her breath away for a moment.
His calmness and self-assurance overwhelmed
her. She smiled. “Is that all you can say
for yourself?” she asked.</p>

<p>He went over and kissed her. “What can I say,
Mother?” he replied. “The story is right here
and I guess I am guilty. But there was really nothing
to it. I merely helped a little to capture the
gang.”</p>

<p>“Just helped a little!” commented Mrs. Stormways.
“You’re always taking some sort of risk. I
don’t know what will ever happen to you.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mother,” pleaded Jack, “you know I
can take care of myself.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the trouble,” she replied. “You
can take care of yourself too well.”</p>

<p>Just then Jack’s younger brother, aged thirteen,
burst into the house. Seeing Jack with his mother,
he cried, “Say, I heard you were playing cops and
robbers; is it true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack and his mother laughed. “Come on, Jack,
tell me about it,” insisted the boy.</p>

<p>But Jack paid no attention to his brother. His
mother said, “I just wonder what your father will
say when he comes home.”</p>

<p>She walked out into the kitchen to continue her
preparations for dinner. In due time, Mr. Stormways
came home carrying an evening paper with
him. As soon as he stepped into the house, his
younger son cried, “Did you hear, Dad? Jack has
been playing cops and robbers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, son, I heard all about it. Too much, in
fact. What do you think we ought to do about it?”</p>

<p>“I think you ought to make him tell us all about
it, Dad,” answered the boy. “He wouldn’t tell me
anything.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll see what we can do about that.
Where is he, by the way?”</p>

<p>“He is upstairs in his room. Shall I call him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, son. Tell him to come down for dinner.
I shall be in the dining room.”</p>

<p>Jack came downstairs. His father was at the
table. As soon as he walked into the room, his
father rose and bowing, said, “May I congratulate
you? Will you please tell us how it feels to be
a hero?”</p>

<p>Jack blushed. “Oh, don’t do, that, Dad,”
pleaded Jack.</p>

<p>But Mr. Stormways was enjoying himself. “Sit
down, my hero,” he said. He led Jack to the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the table and sat him down there, saying,
“Since you are now a hero, you shall preside over
the dinner table.” As Mrs. Stormways came in
her husband called out, “An extra portion of
everything for the hero, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Dad, don’t,” pleaded Jack.</p>

<p>But Mr. Stormways was not to be dissuaded.
Sitting down, he said, “Now tell me, did you capture
the gang all by yourself, or did someone help
you a little?”</p>

<p>Jack smiled. He thought he might as well join
in with his father’s humor. “Well,” he answered,
“Paul and Ken did help a little, but very little.”</p>

<p>“Just what I thought,” remarked his father.
“And tell me another thing,” continued Mr.
Stormways, “did the gangsters run just as soon as
they saw you or did they hesitate for a little
while?”</p>

<p>“They immediately surrendered,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Now let me think,” mused his dad, “what else
was there I wanted to ask you. Oh, yes. I suppose,
that as a reward for your bravery, the president
himself will no doubt come here to congratulate
you and bestow upon you the Congressional
Medal of Honor, is that so?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that, Dad,” replied
Jack. “I imagine that he may be too busy to do
that. But I am sure he will send a representative.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a silent pause for a few seconds,
then Mr. Stormways burst out laughing. “Well,
seriously, fellow,” he said, “don’t you think that
you ought to stop keeping company with gangsters
and all that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, Dad.”</p>

<p>Just then Jack’s younger brother spoke up and
asked for details of the story and Jack complied
by telling all of it.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Mystery of the White Card</span></p>

<p>The boys were at the Morrison home waiting
for Mr. Grey to appear. They had hundreds of
questions to ask him and they hoped that he would
clear up the mystery of the white card. But if he
did not, they would be at a loss as to what to do
next. They would either have to give up or commence
their investigation all over again, and they
were rather tired of the thing by now. Jack remarked,
“I still can’t understand how we happened
to come upon Mr. Grey and follow him. I
don’t suppose he had anything to do with the mystery
of the white card.”</p>

<p>“But it was you who originally began to follow
him,” said Ken.</p>

<p>“That’s right. But now that I think of it, I can’t
understand how I happened to pick on him.”</p>

<p>“Betty described the man who took her for a
walk as tall and thin,” interposed Paul.</p>

<p>“Yes, but there are many tall, thin men in
town,” argued Jack.</p>

<p>“And we came to the conclusion that the man
who would start fires and steal a single book must
be a maniac of some sort.”</p>

<p>Jack laughed. “Well, does Mr. Grey look like
a maniac?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul smiled and remarked, “Well, he does look
rather odd, tall and thin as he is.”</p>

<p>“All that doesn’t get us anywhere,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s not come to any conclusions but
wait until Mr. Grey comes,” remarked Paul.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll clear it all up for us.”</p>

<p>About ten minutes later, the government agent
arrived. He looked like a changed man, dressed
in a summer linen suit and his hair combed neatly
back. “Hello, fellows,” he greeted as he entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Grey,” returned Paul. “Won’t you
sit down?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try,” he said as he took a seat, “but
I’m afraid you fellows are going to question me
so much, you’ll have me standing on my head.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll turn you over and sit you down
again,” spoke up Jack.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Grey,” began Paul, “and by the
way, is that your real name?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. My name is George Wilson.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Wilson, we are mystified by a certain
little thing,” continued Paul, “and I wonder
if you can clear it for us.”</p>

<p>“Try me and we’ll see.”</p>

<p>“The mystery of the white card,” Jack blurted
out. “What is it all about?”</p>

<p>“What white card?” asked the agent mystified.</p>

<p>“You don’t know?” cried Ken.</p>

<p>The man shook his head in complete ignorance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
“I’ll faint,” cried Jack, falling back in his chair
and pretending that he was actually fainting.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is all about,” asked the government
agent. “I don’t even know what you are
talking about.”</p>

<p>“And we thought that you could give us the
solution,” commented Jack. “Now what are we
going to do?”</p>

<p>“Will you please let me in on it?” Mr. Wilson
asked for the second time.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” began Paul, again explaining
the whole thing, this time for the benefit of Mr.
Wilson. “About ten days ago, Ken’s little sister,
Betty, disappeared. Jack happened to find her all
the way out on Leonard Street. Questioning her,
he found that a man had bought her candy, taken
her for a walk and left her there after he gave
her a blank white card.”</p>

<p>“May I see the card?” asked Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>Paul took it out of his pocket and showed it to
him. The agent glanced at it and then said, “Go
on.”</p>

<p>“Well, several days later there happened to be
a fire on Water Street and I rushed into the building.
To make the story short, inside that burning
house I found another white card, an exact duplicate
of the first one.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mr. Wilson, his curiosity now
aroused. “And then what?”</p>

<p>“That isn’t all,” continued Paul. “The next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
a robbery occurred at Professor Link’s and all
that was taken was a single book out of the library.
And what’s more, the same white card was
left.”</p>

<p>“But the point of the story is,” intervened Ken,
“we thought all along that you were the guilty
person and that is how Jack began to follow you.”</p>

<p>“I!” cried the agent, aghast. “How do I come
in on this?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” spoke up Jack, “it was really all
my fault. After talking the thing over, we came
to the conclusion that only a,&mdash;er,&mdash;a maniac sort
of person would do anything like that.”</p>

<p>“And you took me for a maniac?” cried the
agent, bursting out laughing. “That’s a good
one.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“No, I agree with you,” said Mr. Wilson. “I
don’t think it’s quite the thing to be taken for a
maniac. But go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” continued Jack, “I began to follow
you. And the first night I followed you out to
Waters Street, to the exact spot where the fire
occurred, and ...”</p>

<p>“But you must be wrong,” cried Mr. Wilson,
“because I don’t even know where Waters Street
is.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know?” demanded Jack leaping out
of his seat.</p>

<p>The other boys also were by now out of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
seats and staring dumbly at Mr. Wilson. The
agent said, “I remember that I was once followed
by one of you, I couldn’t say who. But I shook him
off quickly. Then I also remember that Paul approached
me one day and asked me where Jones
Street was and I told him.”</p>

<p>“My God!” cried Jack, “I have followed the
wrong man all the time.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” Paul said tensely. “You
haven’t followed the wrong man. On the contrary.
You know what?” They all looked at him curiously.
“There is a man in this town who looks
very much like you, Mr. Wilson, and I am convinced
that he is the guilty party.”</p>

<p>“Now that is interesting,” commented the
agent. “I should certainly like to meet him.”</p>

<p>“Now let me ask you this,” said Paul. “You
don’t know anything about the fires nor about the
robbery at Professor Link’s, do you?”</p>

<p>“I most certainly don’t.”</p>

<p>“Was it you who saved us when Jack and I
were prisoners in the cellar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was me.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait a minute,” interrupted Ken. “Suppose
you tell us how you knew that the boys were
being held there and how you came to know Harriman
and how you came to be a member of the
gang?”</p>

<p>“It’s this way, fellows,” began Mr. Wilson. “I
was put on this case and I followed the gang to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
this town. Looking around for a room I hired one
over the grocery store, from Harriman. At the
time I did not know that he was a member of the
gang, but I soon found it out. Through him, I
came upon the gang. I became friends with Harriman
and did him a few favors. From then on, he
trusted me. After I got on their trail, I waited to
get them with the goods&mdash;that is, they were then
only experimenting and not yet turning out counterfeit
money. Just as soon as they ran off some
fake greenbacks, I got into action.”</p>

<p>“How did you know, then, that we were being
held in the cellar of the empty house?” asked
Paul.</p>

<p>“You see, the gang had a room in the hotel.
And I had a room next door. And when Joe came
and told Moonshine Charlie of holding you prisoners,
I rushed down and freed you.”</p>

<p>“That’s plenty funny,” commented Jack. “If it
was not you whom I was following all the time,
who then was it?”</p>

<p>“That is something I should like to know myself,”
replied the agent.</p>

<p>“Another thing, Mr. Wilson,” said Paul.
“Four days ago, I followed Harriman. On the
street, I noticed you&mdash;or was it you&mdash;passing him
and you nodded to each other. Now was it you or
was it not you?”</p>

<p>“No, it could not have been me,” was the answer,
“because I remember distinctly that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
at the hotel at the time listening in on Moonshine
and his gang.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” continued Paul. “Harriman did
lead me to Main Street where he met Moonshine,
Joe and Pete. But if it was not you who nodded
to Harriman, then I am more convinced than ever
that there is a man in this town who looks very
much like you. In fact he looks so much like you
that even Harriman mistook him for you.”</p>

<p>“Now that is very interesting,” Mr. Wilson
said. “We will have to do something about it.”</p>

<p>“But here is something that is very suspicious,
Mr. Wilson,” Paul said. “You say that at the time
you were at the hotel, but you or the person that
looks like you, walked out of the corner house,
that is, Harriman’s house, only about fifteen minutes
before the grocery store keeper himself came
out. How do you figure that out?”</p>

<p>“You have me puzzled, Paul, if that was the
case. I can’t figure it out.”</p>

<p>The four of them leaned back in their seats and
kept quiet. The boys appeared exhausted from the
ordeal. They thought that at last everything
would be cleared up and now they discovered that
it still remained a mystery. “At last,” muttered
Jack, “we are back where we started. Hooray!”
Paul sighed and kept silent. Ken asked sadly,
“Now what are we going to do?”</p>

<p>His companions shrugged their shoulders. Mr.
Wilson remarked, “I wish I knew how I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
help you. But as a matter of fact, I am leaving on
the midnight express.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said Paul. “I thought that
perhaps you would stay here for several days.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson shook his head. “That is out of the
question,” he answered.</p>

<p>“To come back to the point,” said Jack, “what
do you think we ought to do, Paul?”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“The mystery of the white card, of course.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we will just have to wait and see.
Perhaps we will find some clue one of these days
which will solve it.”</p>

<p>“If we wait until the mystery is solved by itself,
we will never know the solution,” was Ken’s statement.</p>

<p>“Too bad I can’t help you,” said Mr. Wilson
as he rose to go.</p>

<p>They shook hands all around, the boys wishing
Mr. Wilson a pleasant trip and he wishing them
success in unravelling the mystery of the white
card.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Again the White Card</span></p>

<p>All of the following day the boys wandered
about trying their best to form some definite opinion
about the mystery of the white card so that
they might act upon it. But however they discussed
the situation, they could come to no conclusion
nor hit upon any new clue. In desperation,
they gave it up for the present and decided to let
events take their course; perhaps something might
turn up in several days or weeks that would give
them a clue which they could follow with some
chance of clearing up the situation.</p>

<p>Two days later, something did happen, but it
only helped to complicate things further. Paul was
walking along Main Street when he heard an automobile
horn and he turned around to see who it
was. A police car pulled up to the curb and Walters
waved to him. “Hey, there, fellow,” he
called. “Come on, get in.”</p>

<p>Paul got into the car. “Hello, Walters,” he
said, “anything up?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the detective. “I have a very baffling
case to solve and when I saw you walking
along, I thought I might ask you to help me.”
They both laughed and the detective added, “Are
you bent on going any place in particular?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I was going to the library. But I have
plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. Then you can drive along with me
for a while. I hate to drive all by myself with no
one to talk to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Paul. “Where are you
driving to?”</p>

<p>“That’s just it. No place in particular.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the detective, “we got a report
about fifteen minutes ago that a car was stolen.”
He brought a slip of paper out of his pocket and
gave it to Paul. “Here,” he said, “look at it and
then keep your eyes open. We will begin at one
end of the town and ride through street by street.
It may be that the owner parked it somewhere and
forgot the place.”</p>

<p>Paul looked at the slip of paper. He read,
“Ford ... four door sedan ... license number
S 91 52.”</p>

<p>For a while they rode along talking of various
things. They rode down one street and up the next
street. Walters related some experiences of his as
a detective. Finally he remarked, “By the way,
the oddest thing happened to me yesterday. I was
walking along and suddenly I noticed a man that
was the exact image of George Wilson, the government
agent. I was so astonished, I couldn’t
imagine him being in town when two days ago I
saw him off on the train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you stop him?” demanded Paul excitedly.
“Did you see where he went?”</p>

<p>The detective said, “Why, no. That’s just it. I
closed my eyes for a second because I thought
they were deceiving me. When I opened them
again, he was gone.”</p>

<p>“Now isn’t that the worst of luck,” said Paul.
“He is just the man we are looking for.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked Walters. “What do
you want him for?”</p>

<p>“We need him to clear up the mystery of the
white card. We think he is the missing link in the
puzzle.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” remarked the detective. “I
think I remember you telling me something about
this white card mystery. Did you do anything
about it?”</p>

<p>“No. And that is why we are looking for this
man.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, our original clues led up to our following
this man. But we got him mixed up with the
government agent and that is how we happened to
come upon the counterfeit gang. Well, sir, after
all that was cleared up, we questioned Mr. Wilson
but he didn’t know anything about the white
card and then we knew we were up the wrong
tree.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” said the detective, “as far
as I can figure it out, you are back where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
started and now you are looking for him again.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you luck. Maybe if you keep it up
long enough, you will come across another gang
of crooks. But this time finish the job yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we will be able to do that,” returned
Paul smiling. “You see, Jack, Ken and I
are leaving for college in two weeks.”</p>

<p>“We will have to do something about that,”
said the detective. “I will tell the chief to move
the police headquarters to the college or have him
move the college here. Which would you prefer?”</p>

<p>“Neither one. When I get to college, I won’t
have much time for anything except study.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to study?”</p>

<p>“Jack and I are going to study to be doctors.”</p>

<p>“Your father is a doctor, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very respectable profession. I wish I
had gone to college and studied a profession.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you satisfied with being a detective?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m satisfied all right but I guess it’s like
the saying, that when you’re one thing you always
want to be something else.”</p>

<p>They were crossing Main Street and Paul spied
Ken walking along. Hailing his friend, the detective
pulled up to the curb and Ken got into the
car. “Where are you two going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Just going for a ride,” said the detective.
“Want to come along?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, why not. I have nothing in particular to
do right now. I was on my way for a swim, but
this is all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep your eyes open for a Ford four
door sedan, license number S 91 52. Walters is
looking for it,” said Paul.</p>

<p>“Stolen?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the detective, “just removed by the
wrong party.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” spoke up Paul, “Walters here
has come across the mystery man of the white
card, the man that looks like Mr. Wilson.”</p>

<p>Ken leaned forward eagerly. “You mean it?”
he cried. “Did you arrest him, Walters?”</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t want to bother,” the detective
replied.</p>

<p>“Didn’t want to bother!”</p>

<p>“He is kidding you,” said Paul. “The man
looks so much like Mr. Wilson that he couldn’t
believe his own eyes. Well, he closed them for a
second, and when he opened them again, the man
was gone.”</p>

<p>“Just like a detective!” cried Ken.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Walters.</p>

<p>“To close your eyes to things.”</p>

<p>For several seconds there was silence, then
Walters burst out laughing. “That’s a good one,”
he cried, “I’ll have to remember it.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do now?” asked
Ken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders and didn’t answer.
For a short while they rode along in silence. Suddenly,
both Ken and Paul cried simultaneously,
“Look!”</p>

<p>About ten yards ahead of them was a Ford
sedan with the license number S 91 52 parked at
the curb. Walters swung over to the curb and
pulled up directly behind the Ford car.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Mystery Solved</span></p>

<p>The three of them jumped out of the car and
approached the Ford. Walters looked it over,
checked the license number and said, “This is it,
all right.”</p>

<p>Ken threw open the door next to the steering
wheel. “Hey, Paul, Walters,” he cried, “come
here, quick.”</p>

<p>He was joined by his friend and the detective.
“Look,” he muttered and pointed at the driver’s
seat.</p>

<p>They looked. There on the seat lay a white
card. Walters grabbed it and turned it over on
both sides. It was a plain, white, blank card. “Can
you beat that!” gasped Walters.</p>

<p>Paul took his own card out of his pocket and
gave it to Walters. “Here,” he said, “compare the
two.”</p>

<p>The detective made the comparison and announced,
“Identical.”</p>

<p>Ken burst out laughing. The detective asked
angrily, “What are you laughing at, you young
pup?”</p>

<p>“Now it’s your mystery,” answered the boy.
“You look for him and the next time you see him
don’t close your eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Trying to be smart,” countered the detective,
grinning. “Well, I’ll have to start looking for him
all right.”</p>

<p>Walters searched the front and the rear of the
car but he found nothing suspicious. His investigation
completed, he asked Ken to get into the
Ford and follow him. The detective drove back
to police headquarters where the stolen car was
parked and the owner of it was notified.</p>

<p>Ken and Paul walked out of the police headquarters
in high spirits. There was no particular
reason for it but they thought it quite humorous
that Walters was now involved in the mystery of
the white card. And Ken didn’t seem to get tired
of repeating, “From now on, perhaps he will get
out of the habit of closing his eyes.”</p>

<p>And after he said it, he would laugh, assured
that it was a very good joke. Paul said, “Forget
it for a while. Which way are you going?”</p>

<p>“Which way are you going?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was on the way to the library when
Walters picked me up. So I guess I will continue
my trip to the library.”</p>

<p>“That suits me,” said Ken, “I’ll go along.”</p>

<p>Whistling, chatting, they walked along Main
Street when Ken suddenly saw something that
made him quickly alert.</p>

<p>Paul was eyeing a window display as he walked.
He felt his arm pinched and he uttered a muffled
cry. “Hey!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Ken muttered, “Shsh! Look!”</p>

<p>Across the street was the man who looked so
much like Mr. Wilson! The boys gasped. He was
standing in the doorway of a three story apartment
house. The ground floor was occupied by a
haberdashery on one side and a shoe store on the
other. The mystery man, with his wild, maniacal
appearance, glanced both ways, then he walked
off, heading north. Paul cried, “Come on. I’ll take
care of him, Ken. You run into the hall of the
building and see what he may have been up to.”</p>

<p>Ken rushed into the hall. He searched frantically
and at last he found under the stairs a bundle
of rags evidently soaked in gasoline or kerosene,
in flames. The wall and the back of the stairs were
already beginning to smolder. By some luck, there
happened to be a pail of dirty water at the other
end of the hall. He grabbed it and dashed the
water on the fire. The flames were out in a moment.
With the rags soaking wet, he wiped it
across the smoldering wood.</p>

<p>Holding on to the rags, he ran outside and
looked at the number of the building. At the curb
he found a sheet of newspaper which he wrapped
around the wet rags. And to make sure he did not
forget the address, he wrote it down.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Paul had approached the
man and took him under the arm. “Do you mind
if I walk along with you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no. No, not at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“My name is Paul. What is yours?”</p>

<p>“Who, me? I have no name.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said Paul. “I thought everybody
had a name.”</p>

<p>“Everybody except I,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Paul was at a loss what to do or say. On the
spur of the moment, he remarked, “There is a
man who wants to see you. I will take you to him.”</p>

<p>“That is very nice of you. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Straight ahead, down Main Street.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. Let’s hurry, because I don’t want
to keep him waiting. I don’t like to keep people
waiting.”</p>

<p>Just then Ken came running up and took the
man by the other arm. Together they led the man
to police headquarters and into the detectives’
room. Walters was there and as soon as he saw
the boys and the man, he jumped to his feet.
“Where did you get him?” he cried.</p>

<p>“He was looking for you,” said Ken, “so we
thought we would bring him here.”</p>

<p>“Stop kidding, will you, and tell me what it’s
all about?” demanded the detective.</p>

<p>The man stood there very innocently looking
from one to the other. Ken removed the covering
of paper from the rags and showed it to Walters.
Paul said, “We saw him come out of the hall of
a building....”</p>

<p>“357 South Main Street is the correct address,”
said Ken, interrupting. “That bunch of rags was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in flames and the wall and the stairs were already
beginning to smolder.”</p>

<p>“And so we brought him here,” concluded Paul.</p>

<p>The detective turned to the man. “What’s your
name?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders and opened his
arms in a gesture of complete ignorance. “Did
you try to start a fire just before at 357 South
Main Street?” the detective again asked.</p>

<p>But the man kept his mouth shut, grinned and
would say nothing. The detective was growing
red in the face. Paul said, “You ought to have
him examined by a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” asked Walters.</p>

<p>But questioning him was futile and a waste of
breath and effort. The man either would not,
could not, or just did not understand enough to
answer the simple questions. Walters searched
him. In his right coat pocket was found a bunch
of white cards. Paul and the detective took out
their cards and compared them to the bunch.
“Identical,” muttered Walters.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried Ken. “The white card mystery
is solved.”</p>

<p>The man grinned sheepishly. Walters continued
searching him. In the other pockets they found
more white cards, various odds and ends such as
pieces of string, a pocket knife, several pencils,
shoe strings and an empty wallet with a name and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
address. Paul read, “Jerome Walsh, 321 Applebury
Street.”</p>

<p>“Let’s run down there,” suggested Ken.</p>

<p>The detective nodded. “Yes, we’ll do that.
First I will have him examined by a doctor.”</p>

<p>Walters took the man by the arm and led him
out. The boys waited and two minutes later he
returned. “What did you do with him?” asked
Ken.</p>

<p>“I gave him over to one of the men to take care
of. Let’s go,” said Walters.</p>

<p>They went to the back of the building and got
into a police car. Ken plopped into the rear seat
and began to laugh uproariously. “What’s the
joke?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“Take a chance, let’s hear it.”</p>

<p>“What I was laughing at,” said Ken, “is how
much it helps when you keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p>“Aw, keep your mouth shut,” cried the detective,
and the next moment he was himself enjoying
the humor of it.</p>

<p>The car sped through the town and soon pulled
up in front of 321 Applebury Street. It was a
boarding house. Walters rang the bell and a middle
aged woman answered the door. “Does a man
by the name of Jerome Walsh live here?” asked
the detective.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” answered the woman hesitantly.
“He isn’t in just now, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Walters showed his badge and told her who he
was. “That’s all right,” he said. “Take us up to
his room.”</p>

<p>“Did he do anything wrong?” asked the woman.</p>

<p>“We just want to search his room,” said Walters.</p>

<p>“And he is such a harmless man,” mused the
woman.</p>

<p>They followed the woman to the second floor
and she showed them into a small, neatly kept
room. The detective and the boys entered. On a
little table were several books. Paul examined
them. “Look,” he cried, “Professor Link’s book.”</p>

<p>Ken grabbed the volume and looked at it. Inside
was the professor’s name. “So,” he mumbled,
“the mystery at last is solved.”</p>

<p>The detective searched the room and found
many small items that had been no doubt stolen
from any number of places. Turning to the woman,
he asked, “What do you know about this
man, Jerome Walsh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about him,” she answered
meekly. “He has been boarding with me
for almost a year. Once a month a man comes, I
think it is his brother, and pays for his room and
board. Tell me, Mister detective, did Mr. Walsh
do anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” was the answer. “Is there supposed
to be something wrong with him mentally?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the woman replied. “Every
once in a while he acts strangely, but as far as I
know, he is harmless.”</p>

<p>“What sort of strange things would he do?”
asked Paul.</p>

<p>“Well, he would sometimes talk to himself,
sometimes he would go out walking all night long&mdash;little
things like that.”</p>

<p>The detective said, “The next time this man,
his brother or whoever he is, comes to pay his
room and board, I want you to call me. In the
meanwhile, Mr. Walsh is not coming back here
any more.”</p>

<p>“But what did he do?” the woman asked frantically.</p>

<p>“He tried to set a house on fire and he stole an
automobile this morning,” the detective told her.</p>

<p>“Which is not all,” added Paul. “Do you have
the address of this man who visits him?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think I do; I think I must have it
somewhere downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go down, then,” said Walters.</p>

<p>Downstairs, the woman searched for about ten
minutes until at last she found the address and
gave it to the detective. “Very good,” he muttered.
“We will send for him.”</p>

<p>They left. Ken turned to Paul and said, “Let’s
run over to Jack’s and tell him. He’ll drop dead
when he hears it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Paul, “let’s do that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Walters dropped them off in front of the
Stormways home. Paul waved and called, “So
long, Walters.”</p>

<p>“So long.”</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open,” called Ken.</p>

<p>The detective smiled. “And you watch yourself,”
he called back and drove off.</p>

<p>The two boys ran into the house, looking for
their friend. Mrs. Stormways told them that he
was at the garage and they ran out of the house
again. Jack waved to them, his hands grimy with
grease; he was working on his dad’s car. “Hey!”
cried Ken, “the mystery has been broken wide
open.”</p>

<p>“You mean....”</p>

<p>Jack stared at his friends with his mouth open.
He couldn’t believe it. Paul smiled and said,
“That’s right, the mystery is solved.”</p>

<p>“And without me,” moaned Jack, “How could
you finish up the whole thing without me! Tell me
all about it.”</p>

<p>The boys related how it had all happened. Jack
looked very miserable as he listened to the story.
His great regret was that he had not been in on
the exciting final clearing-up of the mystery.</p>

<p>“It’s all right Jack, next week we’ll start college
and we’ll forget all about the Mr. Grey’s and
white cards and counterfeiters. We’ll have to put
our minds on how to learn all of the hard subjects
we’re going to take.” Paul tried to be consoling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Jack, and you can start solving a mystery
as soon as we get there. The mystery I mean is
this&mdash;how are we going to work hard and get
good grades, and still play football, go to dances
and have a good time? Figuring that out will give
you a good tough sleuthing job,” Ken said.</p>

<p>Jack was quite cheerful by now.</p>

<p>“If we can have as good a time at college together
as we have here in Stanhope,” he said,
“We will be lucky. But I’m rather tired of summer
and the town. I get a thrill every time I think
of getting on the train Monday.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” Ken added. “We’ve had plenty of
adventures since the troop has been together, and
we will have plenty more.”</p>

<p>“Sure we will,” said Paul, “And I’m going
home and help my mother pack my clothes right
now. If I don’t watch her she will only put in my
best clothes and leave out things like football
sweaters and old pants.”</p>

<p>And with that all three boys started eagerly for
home.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
